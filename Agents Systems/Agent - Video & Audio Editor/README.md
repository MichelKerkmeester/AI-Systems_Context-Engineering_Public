.

## üß† Native Claude Thinking

### How It Works

The system uses native Claude thinking capabilities to plan optimizations. Before executing any operation, it asks:

**"How many rounds of thinking should I use?"**
- **Quick (2-3 rounds)**: Fast processing for simple operations
- **Standard (4-6 rounds)**: Balanced optimization for most tasks
- **Thorough (7+ rounds)**: Best results for complex workflows

### When Thinking Happens

**System ASKS about thinking when:**
- Ready to execute an operation
- All information gathered
- About to create output
- Moving from planning to action

**System SKIPS thinking question when:**
- Still gathering information (file location, format preference)
- In discovery phase (understanding what you want)
- Won't produce output after next response
- Still clarifying requirements

### Thinking Depth Examples

| Task | Recommended | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Simple conversion | Quick (2-3) | Straightforward operation |
| Audio extraction | Quick (2-3) | Direct extraction |
| Platform optimization | Standard (4-6) | Multiple factors to balance |
| Compression | Standard (4-6) | Quality/size trade-offs |
| Social media set | Thorough (7+) | Platform-specific needs |
| Batch processing | Standard/Thorough | Consistency vs optimization |
| Professional master | Thorough (7+) | Quality critical |

.

## üì¶ Installing Video-Audio MCP

The Video-Audio MCP provides all media processing capabilities.

### Option A: AI-Powered Docker Setup (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop installed ([Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Claude Desktop app ([Download Claude](https://claude.ai/download))
- FFmpeg will be included in the container

**AI-Assisted Installation:**

Copy this prompt to Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant:

```
Help me set up Docker container for the Video-Audio Agent MCP tool.

I need to:
1. Create a directory at "$HOME/MCP Servers"
2. Clone this repo: https://github.com/misbahsy/video-audio-mcp.git
3. Create Dockerfile with FFmpeg and all required codecs
4. Create docker-compose.yml file with proper volume mounts
5. Configure Claude Desktop's claude_desktop_config.json
6. Build and start the container
7. Set up volume mounts for input/output media files

My details:
- Media directory: [YOUR_MEDIA_DIRECTORY_PATH]
- Operating system: [Windows/Mac/Linux]

Please give me the exact commands to run, including:
- Dockerfile with FFmpeg and all codecs
- docker-compose.yml with media volume mounts
- Claude Desktop configuration
```

The AI will provide step-by-step commands for your operating system.

**Quick Docker Template:**

If you want to set up manually, here's what the AI will help you create:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml example structure
version: '3.8'
services:
  video-audio-mcp:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - ~/Videos:/media/input
      - ~/Videos/output:/media/output
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Option B: NPM Global Install (Alternative)

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 18+ installed ([Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/))
- FFmpeg installed separately ([Download FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html))
- Claude Desktop app

**Installation Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Install globally
npm install -g @misbahsy/video-audio-mcp

# 2. Verify installation
video-audio-mcp --version

# 3. Check FFmpeg is available
ffmpeg -version
```

Add to Claude Desktop config:

**Config Location:**
- Mac/Linux: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "video-audio": {
      "command": "video-audio-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Option C: NPX Setup (Quick but Less Stable)

For quick testing without installation:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "video-audio": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@misbahsy/video-audio-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** NPX requires FFmpeg to be installed separately on your system.

### Verifying Installation

**For Docker:**
```bash
# Check container is running
docker ps | grep video-audio

# Test FFmpeg in container
docker exec video-audio-mcp ffmpeg -version

# Check logs
docker logs video-audio-mcp
```

**For NPM/NPX:**
```bash
# Check FFmpeg
ffmpeg -version

# Check codecs
ffmpeg -codecs | grep -E "h264|h265|aac|mp3"
```

Then restart Claude Desktop and test with: "compress test video"

.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Can't find video"** | Provide full path like ~/Desktop/video.mp4 |
| **"Codec not supported"** | Check FFmpeg installation includes all codecs |
| **"File too large"** | Process in segments or check Docker memory allocation |
| **"Quality looks bad"** | Choose "Thorough" thinking for better optimization |
| **"Processing failed"** | Check available disk space and Docker resources |
| **"MCP not connected"** | Check Docker container is running |
| **"FFmpeg not found"** | For NPM setup, install FFmpeg separately |

### Docker-Specific Issues

**Container Problems:**
```bash
# Check container status
docker ps -a | grep video-audio

# View detailed logs
docker logs --tail 50 video-audio-mcp

# Restart container
docker restart video-audio-mcp

# Check resource usage
docker stats video-audio-mcp

# Rebuild if needed
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

**Common Docker Fixes:**
- **Memory issues**: Increase Docker Desktop memory to at least 4GB
- **Disk space**: Ensure enough space for video processing (10GB+ recommended)
- **Volume permissions**: Check mount points have read/write access
- **Codec issues**: Rebuild container to ensure FFmpeg has all codecs

### Thinking-Related Issues

**"Why didn't it ask about thinking?"**
- Still in discovery phase
- Gathering information (path, format, etc.)
- Won't produce output yet

**"Can I change thinking depth?"**
- Yes! Just specify: "Use thorough thinking" or "Quick processing please"

**"What if I'm unsure about thinking depth?"**
- Default to Standard (4-6) for most tasks
- The system will suggest based on complexity

### Path Issues

**Correct Path Formats:**
- Use full paths starting with ~ or /
- Escape spaces: `~/My Videos/clip.mp4`
- Common locations: 
  - Mac: ~/Movies/, ~/Desktop/
  - Windows: ~/Videos/, ~/Desktop/
  - Linux: ~/Videos/, ~/Downloads/

**FFmpeg Codec Issues:**
```bash
# Check available codecs
ffmpeg -codecs

# Essential codecs needed:
# Video: h264, h265, vp9
# Audio: aac, mp3, opus

# If missing, rebuild Docker container or reinstall FFmpeg
```

.
