<<<<<<< Updated upstream
The system will ask about your preferred thinking depth before executing!

.

## 🧠 Native Claude Thinking

### How It Works

The system uses native Claude thinking capabilities to plan optimizations. Before executing any operation, it asks:

**"How many rounds of thinking should I use?"**
- **Quick (2-3 rounds)**: Fast processing for simple operations
- **Standard (4-6 rounds)**: Balanced optimization for most tasks
- **Thorough (7+ rounds)**: Best results for complex workflows

### When Thinking Happens

**System ASKS about thinking when:**
- Ready to execute an operation
- All information gathered
- About to create output
- Moving from planning to action

**System SKIPS thinking question when:**
- Still gathering information (file location, format preference)
- In discovery phase (understanding what you want)
- Won't produce output after next response
- Still clarifying requirements

### Thinking Depth Examples

| Task | Recommended | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Simple resize | Quick (2-3) | Straightforward operation |
| Format conversion | Quick (2-3) | Direct conversion |
| Web optimization | Standard (4-6) | Multiple factors to balance |
| Email preparation | Standard (4-6) | Size/quality trade-offs |
| Social media set | Thorough (7+) | Platform-specific needs |
| Batch processing | Standard/Thorough | Consistency vs optimization |
| Responsive images | Thorough (7+) | Multiple size calculations |
=======
No modes or commands needed! The system automatically understands your intent.

.

## 🧠 Intelligent Conversation System

### Confidence-Based Response

The system automatically adjusts conversation depth based on request clarity:

| Confidence | Range | Response Strategy | Example |
|------------|-------|------------------|---------|
| **Exact** | >0.95 | Immediate execution | "resize to 800px" → Resizes immediately |
| **High** | 0.80-0.95 | Single clarification | "make smaller" → "Target size or percentage?" |
| **Medium** | 0.50-0.79 | Guided exploration | "optimize this" → "For web, email, or storage?" |
| **Low** | <0.50 | Full guidance | "help" → Complete capability overview |

### Intelligent MCP Selection

When thinking MCPs are available:

| Tool | When Used | Thought Count | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Sequential Thinking** | Simple operations | 2-3 thoughts | Single resize, convert |
| **Cascade Thinking** | Complex workflows | 5-7 thoughts | Responsive sets, batch |
| **Imagician MCP** | Always | N/A | Actual image operations |

The system automatically selects the appropriate tool based on:
- Request complexity
- Number of images involved
- Optimization decisions needed
- Quality trade-offs required
- User confidence level

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
### Option B: NPX Setup (Quick)
=======
#### Option B: NPX Setup (Quick but Less Stable)
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

Add to Claude Desktop config:

**Config Location:**
- Mac/Linux: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imagician": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@flowy11/imagician-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
**Note:** Only the Imagician MCP is required. Native Claude thinking replaces the need for thinking MCPs!
=======
### Optional: Thinking MCPs (Enhanced Intelligence)

For even better optimization decisions, add thinking tools:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imagician": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@flowy11/imagician-mcp"]
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    },
    "cascade-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "cascade-thinking-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits of Thinking MCPs:**
- **Sequential Thinking**: 2x faster simple operations
- **Cascade Thinking**: Smarter workflow planning
- **Automatic selection**: Agent chooses the right tool
- **Better optimization**: Explores all options

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Can't find image"** | Provide full path like ~/Desktop/photo.jpg |
| **"Format not supported"** | Check if JPEG, PNG, WebP, or AVIF |
| **"Permission denied"** | Check file permissions or try different location |
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
| **"Quality looks bad"** | Choose "Thorough" thinking for better optimization |
| **"File still too large"** | Try "Thorough" thinking with aggressive compression |
| **"MCP not connected"** | Restart Claude Desktop |

### Thinking-Related Issues

**"Why didn't it ask about thinking?"**
- Still in discovery phase
- Gathering information (path, format, etc.)
- Won't produce output yet

**"Can I change thinking depth?"**
- Yes! Just specify: "Use thorough thinking" or "Quick processing please"

**"What if I'm unsure about thinking depth?"**
- Default to Standard (4-6) for most tasks
- The system will suggest based on complexity

=======
| **"Quality looks bad"** | Increase quality percentage or use less compression |
| **"File still too large"** | Try more aggressive optimization or resize |
| **"MCP not connected"** | Restart Claude Desktop |

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
### Quick Fixes

**Path Issues:**
- Use full paths starting with ~ or /
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- Escape spaces: `~/My Photos/pic.jpg`
=======
- Escape spaces: `~/My Photos/pic.jpg` or `~/My\ Photos/pic.jpg`
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
- Common locations: ~/Desktop/, ~/Downloads/, ~/Pictures/

**Docker Issues:**
