## 1. 🚀 QUICK ACTIVATION

### When to Trigger Figma MCP

**Automatic Triggers from Webflow Context:**
```yaml
Explicit Triggers:
  - "import from Figma"
  - "apply design system"
  - "sync with mockup"
  - "extract styles"
  - "get design specs"
  - "update from prototype"
  - "check design tokens"
  - "import components"

Implicit Triggers (Auto-detect):
  - Design file URL mentioned
  - Component creation requested
  - Style system needed
  - Typography setup mentioned
  - Color palette required
  - When consistency check needed
```

**Context Detection Matrix:**
```yaml
Design Import:
  Trigger: Figma file shared or referenced
  Action: Extract complete design system
  Time: 20-30 seconds
  Coverage: Colors, typography, spacing, components
  
Style Sync:
  Trigger: Design updates mentioned
  Action: Re-fetch latest styles
  Elements: Auto-detect changes
  Validation: Check consistency
  Time: 15-20 seconds
  
Component Mapping:
  Trigger: Component creation requested
  Action: Map Figma to Webflow elements
  Mapping: Auto-generate classes
  Time: 25-35 seconds
  
Token Extraction:
  Trigger: Design system needed
  Action: Extract all design tokens
  Output: CSS variables, classes
  Time: 10-15 seconds
```

**Integration Decision Tree:**
```
Design Integration Needed?
├─ New site setup?
│  └─ Full design import (30-45s)
├─ Style update?
│  └─ Sync specific tokens (15-20s)
├─ Component needed?
