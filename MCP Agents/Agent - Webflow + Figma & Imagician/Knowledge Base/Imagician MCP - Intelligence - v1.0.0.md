## 1. ðŸš€ QUICK ACTIVATION

### When to Trigger Imagician

**Automatic Triggers from Webflow Context:**
```yaml
Explicit Triggers:
  - "optimize image/photo/asset"
  - "compress before uploading"
  - "prepare images for CMS"
  - "create thumbnails"
  - "resize for web"
  - "convert to WebP"

Implicit Triggers (Auto-detect):
  - Image upload mentioned + Webflow context
  - File size >1MB detected
  - Multiple images for batch processing
  - CMS collection has image fields
  - Performance optimization requested
```

**Context Detection Matrix:**
```yaml
Webflow Asset Upload:
  Trigger: User mentions uploading to Webflow
  Action: Optimize first with Imagician
  Time: +10-15 seconds
  Result: 60-80% smaller files
  
CMS Image Fields:
  Trigger: Adding images to collection items
  Action: Process through Imagician
  Batch: Up to 20 images simultaneously
  Savings: 70% average size reduction
  
Bulk Assets:
  Trigger: Multiple images mentioned
  Action: Batch process with consistent settings
  Performance: 2-3 seconds per image
  Memory: Safe up to 50 images
```

**Integration Decision Tree:**
```
Image Operation Needed?
â”œâ”€ Single image <500KB?
â”‚  â””â”€ Skip optimization (already small)
â”œâ”€ Single image >500KB?
â”‚  â””â”€ Optimize with Imagician
â”œâ”€ Multiple images?
â”‚  â””â”€ Batch process (max 20 per batch)
â””â”€ Special format (SVG/GIF)?
   â””â”€ Pass through unchanged
```

Issue: Too many images at once
Frequency: 10% of batch operations
Threshold: >20 images

Solution:
  Automatic Chunking:
    - Split into groups of 10
    - Process sequentially
    - Show progress per chunk
    - Combine results

Memory Management:
  - Clear after each chunk
  - Garbage collection between
  - Monitor memory usage

Recovery Time: No delay, automatic
Success Rate: 100%
```

## Quick Decision Framework

```
If uploading to Webflow:
â”œâ”€ Is it a hero/banner?
â”‚  â””â”€ 2560px, 90%, WebP (3-4s)
â”œâ”€ Is it a product?
â”‚  â””â”€ 1500px square set, 85%, JPEG (10s)
â”œâ”€ Is it a team photo?
â”‚  â””â”€ 800px square, 90%, JPEG (2s)
â”œâ”€ Is it a blog image?
â”‚  â””â”€ 1200px, 85%, WebP (2-3s)
â”œâ”€ Is it over 4MB?
â”‚  â””â”€ Force optimize to <3MB (3-5s)
â””â”€ General content?
   â””â”€ 1920px max, 85%, WebP (2-3s)
```

### Performance Guarantee

```yaml
Optimization Promises:
  - File size: 50-80% reduction
  - Load time: 40-70% faster
  - Quality: Imperceptible loss at 85%
  - Processing: 2-3 seconds average
  - Batch: Linear scaling
  - Success rate: 95%+
  
If optimization fails:
  - Fallback to safe settings
  - Never lose original
  - Always produce usable output
  - Report specific issue
  - Suggest alternative
