•

## 🧠 How It Works

### Intent Recognition Framework

The system automatically detects what you need based on confidence levels:

| Confidence | Range | Response Type | Turns | Example |
|------------|-------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Exact** | >0.95 | Immediate execution | 1-2 | "create blog post titled X" |
| **High** | 0.80-0.95 | Single clarification | 2-3 | "update product" |
| **Medium** | 0.50-0.79 | Guided process | 3-4 | "set up shop" |
| **Low** | <0.50 | Full exploration | 4-6 | "help with site" |

### Performance Standards

All operations follow standardized timing:

| Operation | Time | API Calls | Success Rate |
|-----------|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Single item** | 2-5s | 2-3 | 95% |
| **Design import** | 30-45s | 15-25 | 92% |
| **Image optimize** | 2-3s/img | 1-2 | 98% |
| **Bulk 50 items** | <3min | 30-50 | 85% |
| **Full site** | <8min | 50-100 | 88% |

### Conversation Depth Scaling

**High Clarity → Quick Execution:**
```
User: "create blog post about AI"
System: "Creating blog post about AI!

📝 Adding to Blog Posts collection
✅ Title set, slug generated, draft created

Time: 3 seconds"
```

**Medium Clarity → Brief Guidance:**
```
User: "set up blog"
System: "I'll set up your blog system!

Quick question: Personal blog or business content?
Then I'll create the complete structure."
```

**Low Clarity → Full Guidance:**
```
User: "help"
System: "I'll help with your Webflow site!

What would you like to do?
• Create content
• Import designs
• Manage collections
• Publish changes"
```

•

## 🔧 Installing Webflow MCP (Required)

The Webflow MCP provides core functionality for all operations.

### Option A: NPX Setup (Recommended)

Add to Claude Desktop config:

**Config Location:**
- Mac/Linux: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "webflow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@webflow/mcp-server-webflow"],
      "env": {
        "WEBFLOW_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option B: Docker Setup (Advanced)

For production stability, use Docker:

```bash
# Create directory
mkdir -p "$HOME/MCP Servers/webflow"
cd "$HOME/MCP Servers/webflow"

# Create docker-compose.yml
cat > docker-compose.yml << EOF
version: '3.8'
services:
  webflow-mcp:
    image: node:18-alpine
    command: npx -y @webflow/mcp-server-webflow
    environment:
      - WEBFLOW_API_KEY=your-api-key
    restart: unless-stopped
EOF

# Start container
docker-compose up -d
```

### Additional MCPs (Optional)

For full functionality, also install:

**Figma MCP** (Design Integration):
```json
"figma": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@figma/mcp-server-figma"],
  "env": {
    "FIGMA_API_KEY": "your-figma-key"
  }
}
```

**Imagician MCP** (Image Optimization):
```json
"imagician": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@imagician/mcp-server"],
  "env": {}
}
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Collection not found"** | Check collection name, list available |
| **"Rate limit exceeded"** | Wait 60s, auto-resumes |
| **"Design sync failed"** | Check Figma permissions |
| **"Image too large"** | Auto-optimizes with Imagician |
| **"API key invalid"** | Verify key in config |
| **"MCP not connected"** | Restart Claude Desktop |

### API Rate Limits

All services follow standardized limits:
- **Maximum**: 60 requests/minute
- **Warning**: 50 requests/minute (user notified)
- **Throttle**: 55 requests/minute (auto-slow)
- **Recovery**: 60 second wait at limit

### Quick Fixes

**Check MCP Status:**
```bash
# For NPX
ps aux | grep webflow

# For Docker
docker ps
docker logs webflow-mcp
```

**Restart Services:**
- NPX: Restart Claude Desktop
- Docker: `docker-compose restart`

### Getting Help
- For Webflow issues: Check API documentation
