## 🧠 Native Thinking System

### How It Works

The v1.2.0 release uses Claude's native thinking capabilities with user control:

**You Always Choose the Depth:**
```
System: "How many rounds of thinking should I use?
        • Quick (2-3) - Simple operations
        • Standard (4-6) - Most requests
        • Thorough (7-10) - Complex systems
        • Maximum (10+) - Comprehensive analysis
        
        Or just tell me a specific number!"
```

### Thinking Depth Guidelines

| Depth | Rounds | Best For | Analysis Time |
|-------|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Quick** | 2-3 | Single tasks, simple lists | ~30 seconds |
| **Standard** | 4-6 | Team workspaces, templates | ~1 minute |
| **Thorough** | 7-10 | Multi-team systems, integration | ~2 minutes |
| **Maximum** | 10+ | Enterprise architecture | 2+ minutes |

### When You're Asked

**Always asked before execution:**
- After understanding your request
- When ready to build
- Before any operation

**Only skipped during:**
- Initial discovery questions
- Clarification phase
- When output isn't immediate

.

## 💬 Interactive Intelligence

All operations use intelligent conversation that adapts to your needs:

### Typical Flow
1. You describe what you need in natural language
2. System identifies intent and complexity
3. Asks 1-3 strategic questions if needed
4. **Asks for your thinking preference**
5. Shows structure preview
6. Creates complete workspace
7. Provides visual confirmation
8. Suggests logical next steps
