```

No modes or commands needed! The system automatically understands your intent.

‚Ä¢

## üß† How It Works

### Automatic Intent Detection

The system recognizes what you need and adapts its approach:

| Your Request | System Detects | Response Approach |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| "track projects" | Project management need | Creates full project system |
| "meeting notes" | Content creation | Sets up structured page |
| "organize tasks" | Task management | Builds complete task system |
| "clean up workspace" | Organization task | Archives and reorganizes |
| "CRM for my business" | Complex system | Guides through CRM setup |
| "help" | Uncertain user | Offers guided options |

### Intelligent MCP Selection

| Tool | When Used | Thought Count | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Notion MCP** | Always | N/A | All actual Notion operations |
| **Sequential Thinking** | Simple operations | 2-3 thoughts | Linear tasks, basic updates |
| **Cascade Thinking** | Complex systems | 5-7 thoughts | Workspace design, exploration |

### Conversation Depth Scaling

The system automatically adjusts based on request clarity:

**High Clarity ‚Üí Quick Execution:**
```
User: "project tracker"
System: "I'll create a comprehensive project tracker for you!
Quick question: Will you track deadlines and team assignments?"
[Creates with minimal questions]
```

**Medium Clarity ‚Üí Brief Guidance:**
```
User: "organize my work"
System: "I'll help you organize your work! 
What's most important: tasks, projects, or notes?"
[Asks 1-2 questions then builds]
```

**Low Clarity ‚Üí Full Guidance:**
```
User: "help"
System: "Welcome! I can help you organize anything.
What would you like to track or manage?"
[Guides through options]
```

‚Ä¢

## üí¨ Example Interactions

### Simple Task Management
```
User: I need to track my tasks
System: I'll create a task management system for you!

Quick question: Do you need to track tasks for different projects, 
or is it more about daily to-dos?

[Creates appropriate system based on answer]
```

### Complete Business System
```
User: track everything for my business
System: I'll help you create a complete business system!

This needs several connected components:
1. What's your primary business focus?
2. Team size?
3. Most important metrics to track?

[Builds integrated system with CRM, projects, time tracking, invoicing]
```

### Organization Request
```
User: my workspace is a mess
System: I'll help you organize your workspace! 

Quick assessment:
‚Ä¢ What's the main type of content?
‚Ä¢ How much are we organizing?
‚Ä¢ Want to start fresh or reorganize existing?

[Creates clean structure and organizes content]
```

## üîß Installing MCPs (Required & Optional)

### Required: Notion MCP

The Notion MCP provides core functionality for all Notion operations.

#### Option A: AI-Powered Docker Setup (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop installed ([Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Claude Desktop app ([Download Claude](https://claude.ai/download))
- Notion API key from [notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)

**AI-Assisted Installation:**

Copy this prompt to Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant:

```
Help me set up Docker containers for the Notion Agent MCP tools.

I need to:
1. Create a directory at "$HOME/MCP Servers"
2. Clone these repos:
   - https://github.com/notionhq/mcp-server-notion.git (main tool)
   - https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking.git (optional)
   - https://github.com/cascadethinking/cascade-thinking-mcp.git (optional)
3. Set up environment variables for Notion API key
4. Create Dockerfiles if needed
5. Create a docker-compose.yml file with all services
6. Configure Claude Desktop's claude_desktop_config.json
7. Build and start the containers with docker-compose

My Notion API key is: [YOUR_API_KEY_HERE]
I'm on [Windows/Mac/Linux]. Please give me the exact commands to run.
```

The AI will provide step-by-step commands for your operating system.

#### Option B: NPX Setup (Quick but Less Stable)

Add to Claude Desktop config:

**Config Location:**
- Mac/Linux: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notion": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@notionhq/mcp-server-notion"],
      "env": {
        "NOTION_API_KEY": "your-notion-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Optional: Thinking MCPs (Enhanced Intelligence)

For even better workspace design, add thinking tools:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notion": {
      // ... notion config above
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    },
    "cascade-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "cascade-thinking-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits of Thinking MCPs:**
- **Sequential Thinking**: 2x faster simple operations
- **Cascade Thinking**: Smarter workspace design
- **Automatic selection**: Agent chooses the right tool
- **Better patterns**: Explores all options
- **Intelligent decisions**: Evaluates trade-offs

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Don't know where to start"** | Just describe your goal, system guides you |
| **"Can't find workspace"** | Share pages with your Notion integration |
| **"Permission denied"** | Check integration has access to workspace |
| **"API key not working"** | Verify key in .env or config file |
| **"MCP not connected"** | Restart Claude Desktop, check Docker |

### Quick Fixes

**Docker Issues:**
```bash
# Check if running
docker ps
# View logs
docker logs notion-mcp
# Restart
docker-compose restart
```

**NPX Issues:**
- Ensure Node.js installed
- Check config file syntax
- Restart Claude Desktop
