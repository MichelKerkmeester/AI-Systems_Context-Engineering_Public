## 🧠 How It Works

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
### Thinking Framework

The system always asks about thinking depth before creating anything:

| Complexity | Recommended Rounds | Use Case |
|------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Quick** | 2-3 rounds | Simple pages, basic updates |
| **Standard** | 4-6 rounds | Databases, standard systems |
| **Thorough** | 7-10 rounds | Complex workspaces, full systems |

=======
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
### Automatic Intent Detection

The system recognizes what you need and adapts its approach:

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
| Your Request | System Detects | Thinking Suggestion | Response |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| "track projects" | Project management | 4-6 rounds | Creates full system |
| "meeting notes" | Content creation | 2-3 rounds | Sets up page |
| "organize tasks" | Task management | 5-7 rounds | Builds task system |
| "clean up workspace" | Organization | 7-8 rounds | Archives and reorganizes |
| "CRM for my business" | Complex system | 8-10 rounds | Guides through setup |
| "help" | Uncertain user | Asks after understanding | Offers guided options |

### Conversation Depth Scaling

=======
| Your Request | System Detects | Response Approach |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| "track projects" | Project management need | Creates full project system |
| "meeting notes" | Content creation | Sets up structured page |
| "organize tasks" | Task management | Builds complete task system |
| "clean up workspace" | Organization task | Archives and reorganizes |
| "CRM for my business" | Complex system | Guides through CRM setup |
| "help" | Uncertain user | Offers guided options |

### Intelligent MCP Selection

| Tool | When Used | Thought Count | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Notion MCP** | Always | N/A | All actual Notion operations |
| **Sequential Thinking** | Simple operations | 2-3 thoughts | Linear tasks, basic updates |
| **Cascade Thinking** | Complex systems | 5-7 thoughts | Workspace design, exploration |

### Conversation Depth Scaling

The system automatically adjusts based on request clarity:

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
**High Clarity → Quick Execution:**
```
User: "project tracker"
System: "I'll create a comprehensive project tracker for you!
<<<<<<< Updated upstream

Two quick questions:
1. Will you track deadlines and team assignments?
2. How many thinking rounds? (4-6 recommended for this)"

[Creates with specified thinking depth]
=======
Quick question: Will you track deadlines and team assignments?"
[Creates with minimal questions]
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
```

**Medium Clarity → Brief Guidance:**
```
User: "organize my work"
System: "I'll help you organize your work! 
<<<<<<< Updated upstream

What's most important: tasks, projects, or notes?
Once I understand, I'll ask how thoroughly to plan it."

[Asks 1-2 questions, then thinking preference]
=======

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
```

**Low Clarity → Full Guidance:**
```
User: "help"

What would you like to track or manage?"
<<<<<<< Updated upstream

## 💬 Example Interactions

### Simple Task Management
```
User: I need to track my tasks
<<<<<<< Updated upstream

System: I'll create a task management system for you!

Two quick questions:
1. Do you need to track tasks for different projects, or daily to-dos?
2. How many rounds of thinking should I use? (3-5 recommended)

User: Daily tasks, 4 rounds please

System: Perfect! Using 4 rounds to design your task system...

[Round 1: Analyzing requirements...]
[Round 2: Designing properties...]
[Round 3: Planning views...]
[Round 4: Optimizing workflow...]

✅ Task system created with 4 rounds of optimization!
=======

#### Option B: NPX Setup (Quick but Less Stable)
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

Add to Claude Desktop config:

**Config Location:**
- Mac/Linux: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notion": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@notionhq/mcp-server-notion"],
      "env": {
        "NOTION_API_KEY": "your-notion-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
=======
### Optional: Thinking MCPs (Enhanced Intelligence)

For even better workspace design, add thinking tools:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notion": {
      // ... notion config above
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    },
    "cascade-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "cascade-thinking-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits of Thinking MCPs:**
- **Sequential Thinking**: 2x faster simple operations
- **Cascade Thinking**: Smarter workspace design
- **Automatic selection**: Agent chooses the right tool
- **Better patterns**: Explores all options
- **Intelligent decisions**: Evaluates trade-offs
