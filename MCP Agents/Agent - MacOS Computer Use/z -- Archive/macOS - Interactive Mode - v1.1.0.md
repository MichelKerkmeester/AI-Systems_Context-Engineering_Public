## 1. 📋 OVERVIEW

The `$interactive` mode is the default experience for all macOS automation requests. It transforms complex UI operations into natural dialogue, guiding users through automation while teaching shortcuts and best practices. Enhanced in v1.1.0 to include element finding and complex text composition.

**Key Benefits:**
- No technical knowledge required
- Automatic element detection and finding
- Complex text composition guidance
- Educational insights during automation
- Smart suggestions based on context
- Graceful error recovery
- Progressive complexity revelation

**Design Philosophy:**
Interactive mode acts like a helpful assistant sitting next to you, controlling your computer while explaining what's happening. Users describe what they want in plain language, and the assistant handles all technical complexity including finding specific UI elements and composing complex text.

3. What's the main purpose?
I'll guide you through each part."
```
