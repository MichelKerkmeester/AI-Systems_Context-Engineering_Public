# Notion Agent - User Guide v1.0

## üöÄ What is This?

The Notion Agent transforms natural language into Notion operations, making workspace management 10x easier. Instead of clicking through menus and learning Notion's interface, just describe what you want in plain English.

**Key Benefits:**
- Transform conversations into complete Notion structures
- No need to understand Notion's interface or terminology
- Get intelligent workspace organization with best practices built-in
- Interactive mode guides you through complex setups (DEFAULT)
- Educational system teaches Notion concepts while you work
- Automatic error recovery with helpful suggestions
- Professional patterns applied to every creation

**Key Principle:** If you can describe it, the agent can build it in Notion.

3. Copy and paste the main system file: `Agent - Notion MCP - v1.0.0.md`
4. Save the project

### Step 3: Upload Reference Documents
Upload all reference documents to your project:
- `Notion - Best Practices - v1.0.0.md` (workspace design patterns)
- `Notion - Error Handling - v1.0.0.md` (graceful recovery)

## üß† Intelligent MCP Integration

### Enhanced with Triple MCP Support
The Notion Agent intelligently chooses between three tools:

1. **Notion MCP** - The core tool for all Notion operations
2. **Sequential Thinking MCP** - For simple, straightforward operations
3. **Cascade Thinking MCP** - For complex workspace design and exploration

### Intelligent Selection Logic

**Sequential Thinking is chosen for:**
- Simple page or task creation
- Basic content updates
- Clear, single-step operations
- Quick organization tasks

**Cascade Thinking is chosen for:**
- Interactive mode conversations (DEFAULT)
- Complex workspace setup
- Multi-database systems
- Exploring design options
- Pattern selection decisions

### Adaptive Intelligence
- **Simple requests:** 2-3 thoughts
- **Standard operations:** 3-4 thoughts
- **Interactive guidance:** 3-5 thoughts
- **Complex systems:** 5-7 thoughts with exploration

.

## üéØ How to Use

### Basic Usage (Interactive Mode - DEFAULT)
Simply describe what you need:
```
I need to organize my projects
```

The system will:
1. Start Interactive Mode automatically
2. Ask 2-3 clarifying questions
3. Design the perfect structure
4. Create everything in Notion
5. Teach you why it works

### Example Conversations

**Simple Request:**
```
User: Create a task list
System: I'll help you set up a task management system! 

What types of tasks will you track? (work, personal, or both?)
```

**Complex System:**
```
User: I need a complete CRM for my business
System: Excellent! Let's build a comprehensive CRM system together.

Quick questions to customize this perfectly:
1. What information is most important about each client?
2. Do you track interactions or just contact info?
3. Will this be used by a team or just you?
```

### Mode Selection
| Mode | Command | Use For | Typical MCPs Used |
|------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **Interactive** | DEFAULT | Guided workspace creation | Cascade + Notion |
| **Workspace** | `$workspace` or `$w` | Complete systems | Cascade + Notion |
| **Content** | `$content` or `$c` | Writing and pages | Sequential + Notion |
| **Organize** | `$organize` or `$o` | Restructuring | Sequential + Notion |

## ‚úÖ Output Format

### Visual Feedback for Every Operation
```
üìä Creating: Project Tracker Database
üìç Location: /Workspace/Projects/
‚è≥ Setting up structure...

‚úÖ Created successfully!
‚Ä¢ 8 properties configured
‚Ä¢ 3 views created (Active, Timeline, Archive)
‚Ä¢ Template ready for new projects

üí° Pro tip: Use the Timeline view to visualize project deadlines

Try: "Add first project" or "Show me the timeline"
```

### Intelligent Pattern Application
- **Project Trackers**: Status workflow, timeline views, templates
- **Task Systems**: Priority sorting, due date tracking, assignments
- **Knowledge Bases**: Tags, search optimization, relations
- **Team Spaces**: Permission management, shared resources
- **CRM Systems**: Contact linking, interaction history, pipelines

### Educational Integration
Every operation teaches you Notion:
```
üí° "I used a database instead of pages because it lets you filter, 
sort, and create different views of your projects. This scales 
better as you add more items."
```

## üîß Installing MCP Tools (AI-Assisted Setup)

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed ([Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Claude Desktop app ([Download Claude](https://claude.ai/download))
- Notion API key from [notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)

### AI-Powered Docker Setup

**Step 1: Get Your Notion API Key**
1. Go to [https://www.notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Click "New integration"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Claude Assistant")
4. Copy the API key

**Step 2: Ask Any AI Assistant**
Copy this prompt to Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant:

```
Help me set up Docker containers for the Notion Agent MCP tools.

I need to:
1. Create a directory at "$HOME/MCP Servers"
2. Clone these repos:
   - https://github.com/arben-adm/mcp-sequential-thinking.git
   - https://github.com/drewdotpro/cascade-thinking-mcp.git
   - https://github.com/notionhq/mcp-server-notion.git
3. Create a docker-compose.yml file with services for all three
4. Set up a .env file with NOTION_API_KEY=[my key]
5. Configure Claude Desktop's claude_desktop_config.json
6. Start the containers with docker-compose

I'm on [Windows/Mac/Linux]. Please give me the exact commands to run.
```

**Step 3: Follow AI Instructions**
The AI will provide step-by-step commands for your operating system.

**Step 4: Share Pages with Integration**
In Notion, share any pages you want to manage with your integration.

### Alternative: NPX Installation (Quick but Less Stable)

For Claude Desktop config file:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    },
    "cascade-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "cascade-thinking-mcp"]
    },
    "notion": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@notionhq/mcp-server-notion"],
      "env": {
        "NOTION_API_KEY": "your-notion-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Verification
1. **Docker method**: Check Docker Desktop for 3 running containers
2. **NPX method**: Look for npm processes running
3. **Claude Desktop**: See üîå icon with available tools
4. **Test**: Try "Create a simple task list in Notion"

.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "I don't know where to start"
- Just describe your goal in plain language
- Interactive mode will guide you step by step
- Try: "Help me get organized" or "I need to track [anything]"

### "Can't find my workspace"
- System will help navigate your workspace
- Can create in personal space if needed
- Shows existing similar items to avoid duplicates

### "Permission denied"
- Check workspace access settings
- Share pages with Notion integration
- System suggests alternatives automatically

### "Too complex for me"
- Interactive mode adapts to your expertise
- Starts simple, adds features gradually
- Every step explained in plain English

### MCP Connection Issues
- **Docker not running**: Start Docker Desktop
- **Can't connect**: Restart Claude Desktop
- **Wrong directory**: Check you're in "$HOME/MCP Servers"
- **Permission errors**: Run terminal as administrator (Windows)

### Common Notion Issues
- **Rate limits**: System queues and retries automatically
- **Sync problems**: Handles gracefully with clear status
- **Complex formulas**: Breaks down into simpler parts
- **Large databases**: Suggests optimization strategies
