5. **Rotate** - Rotate by any angle
6. **Flip** - Mirror horizontally or vertically
7. **Get Info** - Extract metadata and specifications
8. **Batch Process** - Apply operations to multiple images

### Smart Understanding
- "Make it smaller" ‚Üí Chooses resize vs compress based on context
- "For my website" ‚Üí Complete web optimization workflow
- "Instagram ready" ‚Üí Perfect 1080x1080 with optimal quality
- "Email this" ‚Üí Reduces to under 5MB automatically
- "Create thumbnails" ‚Üí Generates multiple sizes efficiently

.

## üéØ How to Use

### Basic Usage (Interactive Mode - DEFAULT)
Simply describe what you need:
```
I need to optimize this photo
```

The system will:
1. Start Interactive Mode automatically
2. Ask clarifying questions (web, email, social?)
3. Apply smart defaults
4. Show visual before/after comparison
5. Explain why certain choices were made
6. Suggest next steps

### Example Conversations

**Simple Request:**
```
User: Make this image smaller
System: I'll help make that smaller! Are you looking to:
1. Reduce file size (for faster loading)
2. Change dimensions (resize)
3. Both

What matters most for your use?
```

**Platform Specific:**
```
User: Prepare for Instagram
System: Perfect! I'll optimize for Instagram.

Creating:
‚Ä¢ Feed post (1080x1080 square)
‚Ä¢ Quality: 90% JPEG
‚Ä¢ Optimized for mobile viewing

Ready to proceed?
```

### Mode Selection
| Mode | Command | Use For | Example |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Interactive** | `$interactive` or `$int` | DEFAULT - Guided editing | "edit photo" ‚Üí conversation |
| **Quick** | `$quick` or `$q` | Fast single operations | "$q resize 800px" ‚Üí instant |
| **Batch** | `$batch` or `$b` | Multiple images | "$b compress all" ‚Üí bulk |
| **Platform** | `$platform` or `$p` | Social media | "$p instagram" ‚Üí 1080x1080 |
| **Web** | `$web` or `$w` | Website optimization | "$w optimize" ‚Üí WebP + responsive |

## üîß Installing Imagician MCP (Required)

The Imagician MCP provides the core image editing capabilities. Choose either Docker (stable) or NPX (quick) installation:

### Option A: AI-Powered Docker Setup (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop installed ([Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Claude Desktop app ([Download Claude](https://claude.ai/download))
- Node.js installed for the image processing

**AI-Assisted Installation:**

Copy this prompt to Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant:

```
Help me set up a Docker container for the Imagician MCP tool.

I need to:
1. Create a directory at "$HOME/MCP Servers"
2. Clone this repo:
   - https://github.com/flowy11/imagician.git
3. Create a Dockerfile for the Imagician service
4. Create a docker-compose.yml file
5. Configure Claude Desktop's claude_desktop_config.json
6. Build and start the container with docker-compose

I'm on [Windows/Mac/Linux]. Please give me the exact commands to run.
```

The AI will provide step-by-step commands for your operating system.

**Verification:**
1. Check Docker Desktop for running imagician container
2. Look for the üîå icon in Claude Desktop showing Imagician tools
3. Test with: "Resize an image to 800px width"

### Option B: NPX Installation (Quick Setup)

Add to Claude Desktop config file:

**Mac/Linux:** `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imagician": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@flowy11/imagician"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or for global installation:
```bash
npm install -g @flowy11/imagician
```

Then use in config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imagician": {
      "command": "imagician"
    }
  }
}
```

**Verification:**
1. Restart Claude Desktop
2. Check for Imagician in available tools
3. Test with a simple resize operation

.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "I don't know what to do with my image"
- Just describe your goal in plain language
- Interactive mode will guide you step by step
- Try: "Help me optimize this" or "Make it better for web"

### "Can't find image file"
- Check file name spelling (photo.jpg vs photo.jpeg)
- Ensure file is in current directory
- Try using the full path to the file
- System will suggest alternatives

### "Quality looks bad after editing"
- System warns before quality-reducing operations
- Upscaling always reduces quality (warned)
- Choose higher quality settings if needed
- Keep originals for future edits

### "File size still too large"
- Try more aggressive compression (70-80%)
- Reduce dimensions first, then compress
- Convert to WebP or AVIF for better compression
- System suggests optimal approach

### MCP Connection Issues
- **Docker not running**: Start Docker Desktop
- **Can't connect**: Restart Claude Desktop
- **NPX issues**: Ensure Node.js is installed
- **Permission errors**: Run terminal as administrator (Windows) or use sudo (Mac/Linux)

### Common Setup Problems
- **"Command not found"**: Install Node.js first for NPX method
- **Container won't start**: Check Docker Desktop is running
- **Tools not showing**: Restart Claude Desktop after config changes
- **Image not processing**: Check file exists and is valid image format

### Format Issues
- **RAW files**: Not supported directly, export to JPEG/PNG first
- **HEIC files**: Convert to JPEG first (iPhone photos)
- **Transparency lost**: JPEG doesn't support transparency, use PNG/WebP
- **WebP compatibility**: 95% browser support, JPEG fallback for older browsers

### Getting Help
- For Docker issues: Check container logs in Docker Desktop
- For NPX issues: Check Claude Desktop logs
- For image issues: Verify file format and integrity
- For general issues: The AI assistant can help diagnose problems
