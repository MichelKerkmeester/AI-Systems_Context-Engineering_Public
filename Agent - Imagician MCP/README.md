## üß† Intelligent MCP System (NEW)

### How It Works
The v1.1.0 update adds two thinking tools that make the agent smarter:

**Sequential Thinking (2-3 thoughts):**
- Used for simple, single operations
- Fast execution for clear requests
- Direct path from request to result
- Example: "Resize to 800px" ‚Üí Immediate execution

**Cascade Thinking (5-7 thoughts):**
- Used for complex workflows and exploration
- Evaluates multiple options and trade-offs
- Plans multi-step operations intelligently
- Example: "Optimize for my website" ‚Üí Explores format options, sizes, quality balance

### Automatic Selection
The agent automatically chooses the right thinking tool:

| Your Request | MCP Selected | Why |
|--------------|--------------|-----|
| "Resize to 800px" | Sequential | Single clear operation |
| "Make it smaller" | Cascade | Needs to explore resize vs compress |
| "For my website" | Cascade | Multiple optimization decisions |
| "Convert to JPEG" | Sequential | Direct format conversion |
| "All social media" | Cascade | Complex multi-platform workflow |
