## üéõÔ∏è Operating Modes

### Core Modes

| Mode | Activation | Purpose | Best For | Creates |
|------|------------|---------|----------|---------|
| **$short** | `$short` or `$s` | Quick minimal refinement | Simple clarity boost | Enhanced prompt |
| **$improve** | `$improve` or `$i` (DEFAULT) | Smart enhancement | Most improvements | Enhanced prompt |
| **$refine** | `$full`, `$refine`, or `$r` | Full 3-phase optimization | Maximum quality | Optimized prompt |
| **$interactive** | `$interactive` | Guided help with Q&A | Learning/exploring | Guided prompt |
| **$json** | `$json` or `$j` | API-ready JSON format | Programmatic use | JSON prompt |

### Lovable Sub-Modes (Creates PROMPTS, Not Implementations!)

| Sub-Mode | Activation | Purpose | Creates | Credit Usage |
|----------|------------|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Prototype** | `$prototype` | Visual mockups and concepts | Prototype PROMPT | Low-Medium |
| **Website** | `$website` | Marketing sites and landing pages | Website PROMPT | Medium |
| **App** | `$app` | Full-stack applications | App PROMPT | Medium-High |

**CRITICAL**: These modes create PROMPTS for building these things, NOT the actual prototypes/websites/apps!

.

## üí∞ Credit Optimization Strategy

All Lovable prompts now include:

### Phased Implementation
1. **Phase 1 - Core (Low Credit)**: Essential features only
2. **Phase 2 - Enhancement (Medium Credit)**: Nice-to-have features
3. **Phase 3 - Premium (High Credit)**: Complex features requiring confirmation

### Credit-Saving Principles
- Start with minimal viable features
- Reuse existing components
- Batch related changes
- Use simple solutions first
- Flag high-cost features

### High-Cost Features (Flagged for Confirmation)
- Complex animations
- Multiple API integrations
- Real-time features
- Advanced state management
- Custom component libraries
- Large data processing

.

## üé® Visual Design Matching

When users provide screenshots, mockups, or visual references:
- **Automatic extraction** of colors, layouts, spacing
- **Component identification** from visual references
- **Responsive adaptation** guidance
- **Design system creation** from patterns
- **Exact replication** instructions in prompts

.

## üîß Installing MCP Tools (Recommended)

The system intelligently selects between Sequential and Cascade Thinking based on prompt complexity. Choose either Docker (stable) or NPX (quick) installation:

### Option A: AI-Powered Docker Setup (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop installed ([Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Claude Desktop app ([Download Claude](https://claude.ai/download))

**AI-Assisted Installation:**

Copy this prompt to Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant:

```
Help me set up Docker containers for the Prompt Engineering Assistant MCP tools.

I need to:
1. Create a directory at "$HOME/MCP Servers"
2. Clone these repos:
   - https://github.com/sequentialthinking/sequential-thinking-mcp
   - https://github.com/cascadethinking/cascade-thinking-mcp
3. Create a docker-compose.yml file with services for both
4. Configure Claude Desktop's claude_desktop_config.json
5. Start the containers with docker-compose

I'm on [Windows/Mac/Linux]. Please give me the exact commands to run.
```

The AI will provide step-by-step commands for your operating system.

**Verification:**
1. Check Docker Desktop for 2 running containers
2. Look for the üîå icon in Claude Desktop showing available tools
3. Test with: "$improve write a blog post about AI"

### Option B: NPX Installation (Quick but Less Stable)

Add to Claude Desktop config file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    },
    "cascade-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "cascade-thinking-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Save and restart Claude Desktop.

### MCP Tool Selection

The system intelligently selects thinking tools based on mode and complexity:

| Mode | Tool Selection | Thoughts Used |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| **$short** | Sequential | 1-2 thoughts for clarity |
| **$improve** | Sequential | 2-3 thoughts for enhancement |
| **$refine** | Cascade | 5+ thoughts with branches |
| **$interactive** | Cascade | 3-5 thoughts with exploration |
| **$json** | Sequential | 1-2 thoughts for formatting |
| **Lovable modes** | Sequential/Cascade | 2-5 based on complexity |

**Complexity Triggers:**
- **Unclear requests** ‚Üí Cascade Thinking
- **Multi-step refinement** ‚Üí Cascade Thinking
- **Simple improvements** ‚Üí Sequential Thinking
- **Format changes** ‚Üí Sequential Thinking

.

## üîß Technical Details

### Platform Detection
Automatically optimizes for:
- ChatGPT
- Claude
- Gemini
- Lovable (with credit optimization)
- Other AI platforms

### Artifact Standards
- Always uses `text/markdown` type
- Includes mode and MCP notation
- Compact optimization report
- Credit usage indicators
- Visual reference notes
- Clear "PROMPT not implementation" notices

.

## üìö Example Transformations

### Simple Enhancement
**Before:** "write blog"
**After PROMPT:** "Write a 1200-word blog post on 'Remote Work Productivity' for tech professionals. Include 5 strategies with examples. Tone: conversational yet authoritative."

### With Visual Reference
**Before:** "build this [screenshot]"
**After PROMPT:** "Match the provided screenshot exactly. Replicate the blue header (#1E40AF), three-column grid layout, and 16px spacing. Use the same Inter font and card shadows. Adapt responsively maintaining design proportions."

### Lovable App (Creates PROMPT, Not App!)
**Before:** "build a todo app"
**After PROMPT:** 
```
Create a todo application using React + Supabase.

üí∞ CREDIT OPTIMIZATION:
Phase 1 (Low Credit): Basic CRUD, simple auth
Phase 2 (Medium Credit): Categories, due dates
Phase 3 (High Credit - Confirm): Real-time sync, notifications

Visual Reference: Match provided mockup's task cards
Start with: Dashboard component
Database: todos table with user_id, title, completed

Note: This prompt is for someone to BUILD the app, not the app itself
```

.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### MCP Connection Issues
- **Docker not running**: Start Docker Desktop
- **Can't connect**: Restart Claude Desktop
- **Wrong directory**: Check you're in "$HOME/MCP Servers"
- **Permission errors**: Run terminal as administrator (Windows) or use sudo (Mac/Linux)

### Common Setup Problems
- **"Command not found"**: Ensure Node.js is installed for NPX method
- **Containers won't start**: Check Docker Desktop is running
- **Tools not showing**: Restart Claude Desktop after config changes
- **Rate limits**: Both tools handle this gracefully with retries

### Prompt Issues
- **Too vague?** Use $interactive mode for guidance
- **Not enhanced enough?** Try $refine for full optimization
- **Wrong platform?** System auto-detects but you can specify
- **Credit concerns?** All Lovable prompts include phased implementation

### Getting Help
- For Docker issues: Check container logs in Docker Desktop
- For NPX issues: Check Claude Desktop logs
- For prompt issues: Use $interactive mode for step-by-step guidance

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Never creates content** - Only improves prompts
- **Lovable modes create PROMPTS** - Not actual implementations
- **Always uses artifacts** - Ensures reusability
- **Credit optimization included** - Phased approach for all Lovable prompts
- **Visual matching supported** - Extracts design from references
- **No em dashes** - Uses commas, colons, or periods
- **Works without MCPs** - But enhanced with them

.
