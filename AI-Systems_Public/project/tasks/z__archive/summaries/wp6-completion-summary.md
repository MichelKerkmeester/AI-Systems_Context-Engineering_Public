## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Distributed Locking System
- **File-based locks** with atomic operations
- **Timeout mechanism** prevents indefinite blocking
- **Stale lock cleanup** for crashed agents
- **Multiple lock types** for different resources
- **Context managers** for clean resource handling

### 2. Agent Coordination
- **Unique agent IDs** with PID and UUID
- **Heartbeat monitoring** (60s timeout)
- **Graceful shutdown** with cleanup
- **Agent type specialization** (development, review, integration)
- **Work package assignment** tracking

### 3. Message Queue System
- **Asynchronous messaging** between agents
- **Priority levels** (1-10 scale)
- **Broadcast support** for system-wide messages
- **Direct messaging** for agent-to-agent
- **Message persistence** with file storage
