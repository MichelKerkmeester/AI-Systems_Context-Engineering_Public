# Refactor Test and Iterate

**Created:** 2025-01-19  
**Status:** To Do  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 hours  

## Overview

Following the successful command system refactoring (95% complete), this task focuses on testing, iterating, and finalizing the remaining items to achieve 100% completion and production readiness.

## Context

The command system has been successfully reduced from 10+ commands to 3 (`/memory`, `/save`, `/logic`) with 80% automation through hooks. This task addresses the remaining 5% and ensures all components work flawlessly in the CLI environment.

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Integration Testing (3-4 hours)
- [ ] Test all 6 new hooks in real workflows
  - [ ] workflow-automation-hook.py - Complex task detection
  - [ ] security-scan-hook.py - API key blocking
  - [ ] context-management-hook.py - Auto-save functionality
  - [ ] pattern-extraction-hook.py - Gemini integration
  - [ ] task-management-hook.py - Task lifecycle
  - [ ] parallel-agent-hook.py - Multi-agent suggestions
- [ ] Verify hook priority system (Critical > Quality > Workflow > Context)
- [ ] Test hook performance (<300ms total execution)
- [ ] Validate conflict resolution between hooks
- [ ] Test emergency disable functionality

### 2. Command Testing (2-3 hours)
- [ ] `/memory` command - All subcommands
  - [ ] Search functionality
  - [ ] Manual capture
  - [ ] Automation levels (off/manual/semi/full)
  - [ ] Confirm pending captures
- [ ] `/save` command - Session management
  - [ ] New session creation
  - [ ] Session search
  - [ ] Statistics generation
  - [ ] Archive rotation
- [ ] `/logic` command - System control
  - [ ] Help system navigation
  - [ ] Hook status and control
  - [ ] Task management
  - [ ] Emergency controls
  - [ ] Metrics dashboard

### 3. Multi-Agent Testing (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Test distributed locking mechanism
- [ ] Verify agent registry and heartbeat
- [ ] Test message queue communication
- [ ] Validate resource monitoring limits
- [ ] Test conflict resolution scenarios
- [ ] Verify `/logic tasks parallel` commands
- [ ] Simulate multiple CLI sessions

### 4. Documentation Finalization (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Update hooks-in-cc.md with final specifications
- [ ] Finalize migration guide with real examples
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common issues
- [ ] Create quick reference card (printable)
- [ ] Update README.md with new command structure

### 5. Performance Optimization (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Measure actual hook execution times
- [ ] Optimize slow hooks if any exceed 100ms
- [ ] Test with large codebases
- [ ] Verify resource usage stays within limits
- [ ] Profile memory usage of parallel agents

### 6. Optional: DesktopCommanderMCP Integration (If Desktop App Used)
- [ ] Configure security settings
- [ ] Test process management
- [ ] Verify ripgrep integration
- [ ] Test edit_block functionality
- [ ] Document desktop-specific features

## Success Criteria

1. **All tests pass** - 100% test coverage
2. **Performance targets met** - <300ms total hook execution
3. **No regressions** - All old functionality preserved
4. **Documentation complete** - Clear, comprehensive guides
5. **Production ready** - No critical bugs or issues

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Feature Development
1. Start new session: `/save new feature-auth`
2. Edit multiple files (trigger quality hook)
3. Add API key (trigger security hook)
4. Complex refactoring (trigger workflow hook)
5. Save session: `/save`
6. Verify all hooks executed correctly

### Scenario 2: Multi-Agent Development
1. Open 2+ terminal sessions
2. Start different tasks in each
3. Verify no conflicts or lockouts
4. Test resource limits
5. Merge work from agents

### Scenario 3: Emergency Recovery
1. Cause hook failure
2. Use `/logic emergency` controls
3. Disable specific hooks
4. Re-enable and verify recovery
5. Test rollback capabilities

## Deliverables

1. **Test Report** - Results of all testing scenarios
2. **Performance Report** - Hook execution metrics
3. **Updated Documentation** - Final versions of all docs
4. **Bug Fix List** - Any issues found and fixed
5. **Production Checklist** - Final verification steps

## Notes

- Focus on CLI experience (Warp terminal)
- Ignore desktop-specific features unless explicitly testing
- Prioritize common workflows over edge cases
- Document any limitations discovered

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tests executed and passing
- [ ] Performance within targets
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Ready for production use
- [ ] Command refactoring 100% complete
