## 1. üìã Template Overview

### Lean Base Pattern (NEW DEFAULT)
```markdown
# Title

Main Content
(organized with minimal headers)

---
## üìä Content Integrity Report
Mode: [STRICT preferred]
Changes: [Minimal]
```

### Traditional Full Pattern (Use Sparingly)
```markdown
# Title
[Type | Date | Version]

## Table of Contents (only if >1000 words)
## Summary/Overview (only if essential)
## Main Sections (minimum viable number)
## Conclusion/Next Steps (only if actionable)
## Appendices/References (only if required)

---
## üìä Content Integrity Report
```

### Template Selection Process with Challenges
1. **Ask for thinking rounds** (recommend low: 1-2)
2. **Challenge if 3+ requested**
3. **Ask for content mode** (recommend Strict)
4. **Challenge if Enhanced requested**
5. **Apply minimal viable template first**

---

## 2. üîê Content Mode Applications

### Strict Mode Templates (RECOMMENDED DEFAULT)
**Characteristics:**
- Pure reorganization
- Structural elements only
- Zero content additions
- 100% preservation
- Cleaner output

**Universal Application:**
```markdown
Original: "The API uses JSON format for data exchange"
Strict: "The API uses JSON format for data exchange" [Structure only]
```

### Enhanced Mode Templates (CHALLENGE FIRST)
**Before applying, ask:** "Would Strict mode preserve your voice better?"

**If proceeding:**
```markdown
Original: "The API uses JSON format for data exchange"
Enhanced: "The API uses JSON [AI-ADDED: (JavaScript Object Notation)] format for data exchange."

Always challenge: "Is this addition truly helpful?"
```

---

## 3. üöÄ Minimal Templates (NEW DEFAULT)

### Universal Minimal Pattern
**Structure:** Title ‚Üí Headers (2-3 max) ‚Üí Content  
**Thinking:** 1 round sufficient  
**Challenge:** "This is often all you need!"

```markdown
# Document Title

## First Main Point
Content here, no sub-sections

## Second Main Point
Content here, flat structure

## Third Main Point (if needed)
Content here, simple and clean
```

### Minimal Variants by Type

**Minimal Report**
```markdown
# Report Title

## Summary
One paragraph

## Findings
Bullet points only

## Recommendation
One clear statement
```

**Minimal Guide**
```markdown
# Guide Title

## What You Need
Simple list

## Steps
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

## Done
What success looks like
```

**Minimal Technical**
```markdown
# Technical Document

## Overview
Brief description

## Implementation
Code or specs (unchanged)

## Usage
Simple examples
```

---

## 4. üìÑ General Templates

### Standard Report Pattern

**Lean Version (Recommended)**
```markdown
# Report Title

## Key Finding
Direct statement of main discovery

## Supporting Data
- Point 1
- Point 2
- Point 3

## Action Required
Single, clear next step
```

**Traditional Version (Challenge First)**
Before using: "Could the lean version work instead?"

```markdown
# Report Title
## Executive Summary
## 1. Introduction
## 2. Findings
## 3. Analysis
## 4. Recommendations
## 5. Conclusion

Challenge: "Do we need all 5 sections, or would 3 work?"
```

### How-To Guide Pattern

**Lean Version (Start Here)**
```markdown
# How to [Task]

## Need
- Item 1
- Item 2

## Steps
1. Do this
2. Then this
3. Finally this

## Troubleshooting (only if critical)
Common issue ‚Üí Solution
```

**Enhanced Version (Question Necessity)**
Challenge: "Would the lean version be clearer?"

Add only if essential:
- Prerequisites section
- Detailed explanations
- Multiple examples
- Tips and warnings

---

## 5. üíª Technical Templates

### API Documentation Pattern

**Minimal Structure (Try First)**
```markdown
# API Name

## Endpoints
GET /resource - Description
POST /resource - Description

## Auth
How to authenticate

## Errors
Common error codes
```

**Standard Structure (If Needed)**
Challenge: "Is full structure necessary?"

```markdown
# API Documentation
## Authentication
## Base URL
## Endpoints
### GET /resource
**Parameters:** Table only if many
**Response:** Example only if complex
**Errors:** List only if non-standard
```

### Software Manual Pattern

**Lean Approach**
```markdown
# Software Name

## Install
Single command or link

## Use
Most common operations

## Help
Where to get support
```

**Challenge for Complex Manuals:**
- "Could we provide a quick start guide instead of full documentation?"
- "Would examples be clearer than explanations?"
- "Can we link to detailed docs instead of including everything?"

## 6. üìö Academic Templates

### Research Paper Pattern

**Simplified Academic (Recommended)**
```markdown
# Title

## Abstract (150 words max)
Brief summary

## Main Argument
Core thesis and support

## Evidence
Key data points

## Conclusion
What this means

## References
Essential citations only
```

**Traditional Academic (Challenge)**
Before using: "Is full academic structure required, or would simplified work?"

```markdown
## Abstract
## 1. Introduction
   ### 1.1 Background (merge with intro?)
   ### 1.2 Problem Statement (merge with intro?)
   ### 1.3 Research Questions (necessary?)
## 2. Literature Review (essential?)
## 3. Methodology
## 4. Results
## 5. Discussion (combine with results?)
## 6. Conclusion

Challenge each subsection: "Does this add value?"
```

### Essay Pattern

**Clean Essay Structure**
```markdown
# Essay Title

Introduction with thesis

## Executive Summary (3 sentences max)
## Problem & Solution (combined section)
## Investment & ROI (single table)
## Next Steps (bullet points)

Avoid: Long backgrounds, multiple appendices, complex financials
```

### Executive Memo Pattern

**Ultra-Lean Memo**

Our company has been experiencing significant challenges with customer satisfaction 
metrics over the past quarter with response times increasing from 2 hours to 8 hours 
support team overwhelmed handling 500 tickets daily when designed for 200 NPS scores 
dropped from 72 to 45 which is below acceptable thresholds we need to hire more staff 
implement new systems and revise our processes to address these issues...

[Complex multi-section format only if specifically requested]

### Random Notes ‚Üí Clean Structure

**BEFORE:**
```
meeting with john about project timeline concerns budget might need adjustment 
sarah suggested new vendor could save 20% delivery still on track for Q3 
need to review contracts by friday decision needed on remote work policy
```

[Keep technical content as-is]

## General Part
[Simple formatting only]

## Summary
[One paragraph combining both]
```

**Challenge Complex Hybrids:**

## üìä Template Selection Matrix

### Lean Selection Guide

```python
# Selection logic only
def select_template(word_count, structure_clarity):
    if word_count < 500:
        return "Minimal template" if structure_clarity else "Add 2-3 headers"
    elif word_count < 2000:
        return "Minimal + TOC" if structure_clarity else "Standard template"
    elif word_count < 5000:
        return "Standard template" if structure_clarity else "Standard + sections"
    else:
        return "Consider splitting into multiple documents"
```

### Challenge Questions by Length

| Word Count | Challenge Question |
|------------|-------------------|
| <500 | "Do we need any structure beyond headers?" |
| 500-2000 | "Would 3 sections be clearer than 7?" |
| 2000-5000 | "Could this be shorter?" |
| >5000 | "Should this be multiple documents?" |

---

## üéØ Quick Template Recognition

### Lean Recognition Pattern

| Keywords Detected | Traditional Choice | Lean Override | Challenge Used |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| "report", "analysis" | Complex report | 3-section summary | "Executives prefer brief" |
| "guide", "how-to" | Detailed steps | Simple steps | "Clarity over detail" |
| "proposal" | Multi-page | One-pager | "Decision makers are busy" |
| "documentation" | Comprehensive | Quick reference | "Users scan, not read" |
| Mixed indicators | Hybrid complex | Simple + appendix | "Focus on main message" |

## ü§î ATLAS Integration for Templates

**Reference:** Full framework ‚Üí **Document Beautifier - ATLAS Thinking Framework.md**

### Template-Specific ATLAS Application

**A** - Assess: Which template is minimally viable?  
**T** - Transform: Pick simplest structure  
**L** - Layer: Add only essential formatting  
**A** - Assess: Is it readable without more?  
**S** - Synthesize: Deliver with simpler alternative noted  

### Thinking Rounds by Template

| Template Type | Traditional Rounds | Lean Approach | Rationale |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Minimal | N/A | 1 round | Already simple |
| Standard | 3-4 rounds | 2 rounds | Focus on essentials |
| Complex | 5 rounds | 3 rounds | Simplify first |
| Hybrid | 5 rounds | 2-3 rounds | Separate concerns |

## üìà Success Patterns

### What Works (Track These)
- One-page documents: 80% satisfaction
- 3-section structure: Optimal clarity
- Bullet points over paragraphs: Better scanning
- Minimal formatting: Faster reading
- Strict mode: Preserves authenticity

### What to Avoid (Challenge These)
- 5+ sections without clear need
- Nested hierarchies beyond 2 levels
- Enhanced mode as default
- Complex templates for simple content
- Over-explaining structure

---

## üéì Template Philosophy

### The Lean Template Principles

1. **Start with minimal** - Add only if it fails
2. **Challenge every section** - Must earn its place
3. **Prefer flat structure** - Hierarchies confuse
4. **Question enhancement** - Usually unnecessary
5. **Default to simple** - Complexity needs justification

### The Ultimate Test
> "If removing this section/format doesn't hurt understanding, remove it."

## üîß Quick Commands for Templates

### Template Commands
- `$minimal template` - Bare minimum structure
- `$lean template` - Essential structure only
- `$standard template` - Balanced approach
- `$full template` - Complete (challenge first)

### Quick Conversions
- `$simplify template` - Reduce current template
- `$flatten structure` - Remove hierarchy
- `$strip formatting` - Remove excess

---

*Templates: Start minimal, add only what's essential. Every template should be challenged before application. The best structure is invisible - content matters more than format.*
