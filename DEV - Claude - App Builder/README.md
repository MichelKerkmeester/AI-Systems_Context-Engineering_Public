# Claude App Builder - User Guide v2.0

## üöÄ What is This?

The Claude App Builder transforms Claude into an elite app architect, building functional web applications and AI demos directly in Claude artifacts. Instead of explaining how to code, Claude builds complete, working applications ready for immediate use.

**Key Benefits:**
- Transform ideas into functional web apps in minutes
- No coding knowledge required - just describe what you want
- Professional UI/UX with fluid responsive design built-in
- Three specialized modes for different app types
- Sequential thinking ensures thoughtful architecture
- Works immediately in Claude artifacts (no external setup)
- Complete documentation with every app
- **Enhanced with MCP tools for search, docs, and UI components**

**Key Principle:** If you can imagine it, Claude can build it as a working app.

## üîß Installing MCP Tools (Recommended)

### Option A: AI-Powered Setup (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Claude Desktop app ([Download Claude](https://claude.ai/download))
- Python 3.10+ with UV (for uvx method) OR Node.js (for npx method)

**AI-Assisted Installation:**

Copy this prompt to Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant:

```
Help me set up MCP tools for Claude App Builder.

I need to install:
1. Sequential Thinking MCP (REQUIRED)
   - Option A: uvx method (full features)
   - Option B: npx method (simpler)
2. Web Search MCPs (optional for $search)
   - Tavily (need API key)
   - Brave Search (need API key)
3. Context7 MCP (optional for $docs)
4. UI Component MCPs (built-in, but can add if needed)

I'm on [Windows/Mac/Linux]. Please give me the exact configuration for Claude Desktop's settings.
```

The AI will provide the complete JSON configuration for your system.

### Option B: Manual Installation

**1. Sequential Thinking (REQUIRED):**

Using uvx (full features):
```json
{
  "sequential-thinking": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
      "--from",
      "git+https://github.com/arben-adm/mcp-sequential-thinking",
      "--with",
      "portalocker",
      "mcp-sequential-thinking"
    ]
  }
}
```

Using npx (simpler):
```json
{
  "sequential-thinking": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
  }
}
```

**2. Search MCPs (for $search):**

Tavily:
```json
{
  "tavily": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-tavily"],
    "env": {
      "TAVILY_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
    }
  }
}
```

Brave:
```json
{
  "brave-search": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search"],
    "env": {
      "BRAVE_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Documentation (for $docs):**
```json
{
  "context7": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@context7/mcp-server"]
  }
}
```

**Verification:**
1. Restart Claude Desktop after adding MCPs
2. Look for the üîå icon showing available tools
3. Test with: "Build a $app calculator"

.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "App won't render"
- Check React syntax errors in console
- Ensure all imports are from allowed libraries
- Verify no localStorage usage
- Confirm single artifact structure

### "Responsive design issues"
- All measurements use clamp() formulas
- Test at 320px, 768px, and 1920px widths
- Check fluid typography scaling
- Verify container constraints

### "Can't use external data"
- Use window.fs.readFile for uploaded files
- No external API calls allowed
- Work with local state only
- Consider mock data for demos

### "Sequential Thinking not working"
- Ensure MCP is installed correctly
- Restart Claude Desktop
- Check for Python/Node.js installation
- Try alternative installation method

### MCP Connection Issues
- **MCP not found**: Check installation path
- **Can't connect**: Restart Claude Desktop
- **Permission errors**: Run as administrator (Windows) or use sudo (Mac/Linux)
- **API key issues**: Verify keys are correct and active

### Common Setup Problems
- **"Command not found"**: Install Python/UV for uvx or Node.js for npx
- **Tools not showing**: Restart Claude Desktop after config changes
- **Rate limits**: API services may have usage limits
- **Version conflicts**: Update to latest MCP versions

### App-Specific Issues
- **Performance**: Optimize with React.memo and useMemo
- **State management**: Use useReducer for complex state
- **File reading**: Handle errors gracefully
- **AI completions**: Add loading states

### Getting Help
- Check browser console for errors
- Review artifact constraints in documentation
- Test in different viewport sizes
- The AI assistant can debug specific issues

.
