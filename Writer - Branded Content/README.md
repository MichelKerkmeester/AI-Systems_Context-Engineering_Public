## ðŸŽ¨ PRO TIP: Make This YOUR Brand Voice!

**Example customization prompt:**
```
$full Improve this prompt '''
Transform the Branded Content Writer system into a [YOUR ROLE] writer for [YOUR BRAND].

## ðŸ§  Enhanced Intelligence: Dual MCP Support

### What's New in v3.0?
The Branded Content Writer now intelligently chooses between two thinking tools based on your content's complexity:

1. **Sequential Thinking MCP** - For straightforward, linear content creation
2. **Cascade Thinking MCP** - For complex content requiring exploration of multiple approaches

The system automatically selects the best tool and adapts the number of analysis thoughts (minimum 1, scaling up based on complexity).

### Intelligent Selection Logic

**Sequential Thinking is chosen for:**
- Clear content requests with specified platform/format
- Write (`$w`) and Share (`$s`) modes with simple requirements
- Single framework applications
- Direct edits or rewrites
- Straightforward marketing insights
- Quick social media posts

**Cascade Thinking is chosen for:**
- Improve (`$i`) mode with VEST evaluation and refinement
- Unclear platform/audience requiring exploration
- Content mentioning "different approaches" or "variations"
- Complex campaign narratives
- Multiple framework options that could work
- Strategic content requiring angle exploration
- Creating 3 variations that need different strategic approaches

### Adaptive Thought Process

The system now uses a flexible approach:
- **Minimum:** 1 thought (for very simple edits)
- **Simple posts:** 1-2 thoughts
- **Standard content:** 2-3 thoughts
- **Complex narratives:** 3-5 thoughts with potential branching
- **Full improvement cycles:** 5+ thoughts with multiple exploration branches

## ðŸ”§ Installing MCP Tools (Optional but Recommended)

Both tools work independently, so you can install one or both based on your needs.

### Sequential Thinking MCP Installation

**For straightforward content creation:**

1. **Edit your Claude Desktop configuration:**
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. **Add Sequential Thinking:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cascade Thinking MCP Installation

**For complex content strategy with branching:**

1. **Add to the same configuration file:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cascade-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "cascade-thinking-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Installing Both Tools

**For maximum flexibility:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    },
    "cascade-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "cascade-thinking-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Save and restart Claude Desktop**

4. **Verify installation** by looking for the ðŸ”Œ icon showing available tools

**Note**: The system works without these tools but provides enhanced content planning when available.

2. **Mandatory structure with metadata:**
   - Framework used (if applicable)
   - Mode (write/share/connect/improve)
   - Tone (natural by default)
   - Platform (if specified)
   - Context (from your query)
   - **MCP USED** (which tool was used for planning)
3. **3 variations minimum:**
   - **Most concise:** Fewest words, maximum impact

### Example Output Structure:
```
FRAMEWORK: SVC (Situationâ€¢Valueâ€¢Connection)

TONE: $natural
PLATFORM: LinkedIn

MCP USED: Sequential Thinking

Stock photos killed our CTR. Real employees increased it by 47%.

---

## Variations

### Most concise:
Stock photos killed our CTR. Real employees: +47%. You?

### Most authentic:
Client fought us on using employee photos vs stock. We A/B tested anyway. 
Real faces won by 47%. Sometimes "unprofessional" is exactly what people 
want. When's your last visual audit?

### Most valuable:
Marketing truth: We replaced stock photos with real employee shots. CTR 
jumped 47%, cost per lead dropped 31%. Test: Swap one hero image for 
authentic photo. Track for 2 weeks. Share results?
```

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

### 1. Specify Platform for Optimized Content
```
Write a Twitter thread about content marketing ROI

Create an Instagram caption for our new campaign launch

Draft a LinkedIn article about marketing automation
```

### 2. Use Frameworks Directly
Request specific frameworks when you know what you need:
```
Use the CASE framework to tell our product launch story

Apply QPT to challenge assumptions about email marketing

Create a PATH framework story about fixing our attribution
```

### 3. The Magic of $improve Mode
This mode automatically:
- Creates initial content
- Evaluates it with the 20-point VEST framework
- Identifies weaknesses
- Delivers refined versions
- Shows you exactly what was improved
- **Uses Cascade Thinking to explore multiple improvement strategies**

Perfect for high-stakes content!

### 4. Complex Content Benefits from Cascade Thinking
When dealing with unclear requirements or needing multiple strategic approaches, the system may use Cascade Thinking to:
- Explore different framework options
- Test various tone combinations
- Branch into specialized content strategies
- Ensure the best possible variations

### 5. Natural Voice is Default
The system defaults to `$natural` tone - authentic voice with:
- Genuine uncertainty ("Still figuring out why...")
- Conversational fragments
- Real campaign stories
- Team credit naturally included

.

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "It's not using any MCP tool"
- Check if MCPs are installed (look for ðŸ”Œ icon)
- The system works fine without them
- You'll see "MCP tools not available" notation

### "It's using the wrong MCP tool"
- The system chooses based on complexity indicators
- `$improve` mode typically uses Cascade Thinking
- Simple content uses Sequential Thinking
- This is optimized behavior

### "Too many/few thoughts being used"
- v3.0 adapts thought count to complexity
- Simple edits might use just 1 thought
- Complex content might use 5+
- This is normal and optimized behavior

### "The content feels generic"
- Add more context about your campaign/audience
- Specify platform for optimized voice
- Use specific frameworks for structure
- Include real metrics/examples in your request

### "Wrong tone for my brand"
- See customization guide above
- Adjust Sarah Chen's voice to match yours
- Keep the system structure, change the personality
