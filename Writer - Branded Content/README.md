**Result:** Story about accidental test email that revealed winning formula

### Quick Social Post
**User:** "$write LinkedIn post about stock photos"
**Result:** 
- Most concise: "Stock photos killed our CTR. Real employees: +47%. You?"
- Most authentic: "Client fought us on employee photos. We tested anyway..."
- Most valuable: "Marketing truth: Replace stock with real faces. CTR +47%..."

### Knowledge Sharing
**User:** "$share what we learned about pop-ups"
**Result:** PATH framework story about discovering exit intent vs immediate pop-ups

.

## üîß Installing MCP Tools (Recommended)

The system intelligently selects between these based on content complexity. Choose either Docker (stable) or NPX (quick) installation:

### Option A: AI-Powered Docker Setup (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop installed ([Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Claude Desktop app ([Download Claude](https://claude.ai/download))

**AI-Assisted Installation:**

Copy this prompt to Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant:

```
Help me set up Docker containers for the Branded Content Writer MCP tools.

I need to:
1. Create a directory at "$HOME/MCP Servers"
2. Clone these repos:
   - https://github.com/arben-adm/mcp-sequential-thinking.git
   - https://github.com/drewdotpro/cascade-thinking-mcp.git
3. Create a docker-compose.yml file with services for both
4. Configure Claude Desktop's claude_desktop_config.json
5. Start the containers with docker-compose

I'm on [Windows/Mac/Linux]. Please give me the exact commands to run.
```

The AI will provide step-by-step commands for your operating system.

**Verification:**
1. Check Docker Desktop for 2 running containers
2. Look for the üîå icon in Claude Desktop showing available tools
3. Test with: "$write a post about marketing automation"

### Option B: NPX Installation (Quick but Less Stable)

Add to Claude Desktop config file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    },
    "cascade-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "cascade-thinking-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Save and restart Claude Desktop.

## üé® Customization Guide

### Transform Into ANY Brand Voice

The system comes configured as "Sarah Chen" but is fully customizable using the [Prompt Improver](https://github.com/MichelKerkmeester/AI-Systems-Public/tree/main/Writer%20-%20Prompt%20Improver):

```
$full Improve this prompt '''
Transform the Branded Content Writer system into a [YOUR ROLE] writer for [YOUR BRAND].

Current: Sarah Chen, marketing leader, 10+ years, collaborative voice
Target: [YOUR NAME/BRAND], [YOUR ROLE], [YOUR EXPERIENCE], [YOUR VOICE TRAITS]

Keep the framework structure and 3-variation output system.
Adapt examples to [YOUR INDUSTRY].
'''
```

**Example for Tech Startup Founder:**
```
Transform into a startup founder voice:
- Replace marketing focus with product/growth focus
- Change from team credit to startup hustle stories
- Adjust from "still figuring out" to "rapidly iterating"
- Keep frameworks but use startup examples
```

.

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Let Interactive Mode Guide You
Default mode asks the right questions to uncover great stories:
- What went wrong? (Finds authentic moments)
- Who helped? (Natural team credit)
- What surprised you? (Genuine insights)

### 2. Specify Platform for Optimization
```
Write a Twitter thread about conversion optimization
Create LinkedIn post celebrating team win
Draft email nurture sequence intro
```

### 3. Use Frameworks Directly
When you know what you need:
```
Use CASE framework for our product launch story
Apply PATH to explain our pivot
Create QPT post challenging marketing assumptions
```

### 4. The Magic of $improve Mode
- Creates initial content
- Evaluates with 20-point VEST framework
- Automatically refines weak areas
- Guarantees 18+ score
- Shows exactly what improved

### 5. Embrace Natural Imperfections
Best performing content includes:
- "Still testing why this works..."
- "Our intern spotted the pattern"
- "Took us 6 months to figure out"
- Fragments. For emphasis.

.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### MCP Connection Issues
- **Docker not running**: Start Docker Desktop
- **Can't connect**: Restart Claude Desktop
- **Wrong directory**: Check you're in "$HOME/MCP Servers"
- **Permission errors**: Run terminal as administrator (Windows) or use sudo (Mac/Linux)

### Common Setup Problems
- **"Command not found"**: Ensure Node.js is installed for NPX method
- **Containers won't start**: Check Docker Desktop is running
- **Tools not showing**: Restart Claude Desktop after config changes
- **Rate limits**: Both tools handle this gracefully with retries

### Content Issues
- **Too polished**: Let natural imperfections through
- **Missing story**: Use interactive mode to dig deeper
- **No team credit**: Ask "Who contributed to this?"
- **Lacks data**: Include specific metrics
- **Wrong voice**: Check Sarah's DO's and DON'T's

### Getting Help
- For Docker issues: Check container logs in Docker Desktop
- For NPX issues: Check Claude Desktop logs
- For content issues: Use $improve mode for automatic enhancement

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Always includes failures** - Authenticity builds trust
- **Credits team naturally** - "Our designer noticed..."
- **No em dashes** - Uses commas, colons, or periods
- **Works without MCPs** - But enhanced with them
- **Preserves rough edges** - Perfect polish feels fake

## üì¶ Version History

- **v3.0.0**: Interactive mode default, VEST scoring, enhanced MCP integration
- **v2.0.0**: Added framework library and improve mode
- **v1.0.0**: Initial Sarah Chen voice implementation

## üéØ Key Principles

1. **Great marketing admits what didn't work** - Failure stories teach
2. **Team credit makes everyone look good** - Collaboration beats ego
3. **Natural voice outperforms polish** - Authenticity drives engagement
4. **Process transparency builds trust** - Show the messy middle
5. **Data needs human context** - Numbers alone don't connect
