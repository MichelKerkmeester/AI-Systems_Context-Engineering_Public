## Overview

The Branded Content Writer v4.0.0 is a complete ecosystem for creating marketing content that celebrates failures, credits teams, and enables immediate testing. Built on Sarah Chen's philosophy of "failure transparency," it combines systematic authenticity with genuine human connection through 7 interconnected document systems.

## ✨ Core Philosophy

### The Voice Trinity Framework
Every piece of content maintains this precise balance:
- **50% Collaborative**: Team wins, shared credit ("Our designer spotted...")
- **30% Vulnerable**: Failures teach everything ("Spent $50k before realizing...")
- **20% Empowering**: Enable immediate testing ("Try this tomorrow, report back?")

### Systematic Authenticity
Natural imperfections are deliberately engineered, not random:
- Frequency: 1 per 300-400 words
- Types: "Still testing...", "Not sure why...", "... anyway."
- Purpose: Build trust through genuine uncertainty

.

## 🔧 Embedded Prompt Improvement

### Invisible Clarity Enhancement
The system automatically improves vague requests without you noticing:

**What You Type** → **What System Processes**
- "IG campaign" → "Instagram campaign"
- "fix CTR" → "improve click-through rate"
- "need campaign" → "create campaign"
- "B2B ABM strategy" → "business to business account-based marketing strategy"

### Preserved Authenticity
- "campaign tanked" → stays "campaign tanked" (emotion preserved)
- "urgently need" → stays "urgently need" (urgency maintained)
- Mode commands ($write, $improve) → never modified

.

## 🔧 Installing MCP Tools (Recommended)

The system intelligently selects between Sequential and Cascade Thinking based on content complexity. Choose either Docker (stable) or NPX (quick) installation:

### Option A: AI-Powered Docker Setup (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop installed ([Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Claude Desktop app ([Download Claude](https://claude.ai/download))

**AI-Assisted Installation:**

Copy this prompt to Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant:

```
Help me set up Docker containers for the Branded Content Writer MCP tools.

I need to:
1. Create a directory at "$HOME/MCP Servers"
2. Clone these repos:
   - https://github.com/arben-adm/mcp-sequential-thinking.git
   - https://github.com/drewdotpro/cascade-thinking-mcp.git
3. Create a docker-compose.yml file with services for both
4. Configure Claude Desktop's claude_desktop_config.json
5. Start the containers with docker-compose

I'm on [Windows/Mac/Linux]. Please give me the exact commands to run.
```

The AI will provide step-by-step commands for your operating system.

**Verification:**
1. Check Docker Desktop for 2 running containers
2. Look for the 🔌 icon in Claude Desktop showing available tools
3. Test with: "$write a post about marketing automation"

### Option B: NPX Installation (Quick but Less Stable)

Add to Claude Desktop config file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    },
    "cascade-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "cascade-thinking-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Save and restart Claude Desktop.

### MCP Tool Selection

The system intelligently selects thinking tools based on mode and complexity:

| Mode | Tool Selection | Thoughts Used |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| **Interactive** | **Always Cascade** | 3-5+ thoughts with exploration |
| **Write ($w)** | Sequential | 2-3 thoughts for content |
| **Share ($s)** | Sequential | 2-3 thoughts for insights |
| **Connect ($c)** | Sequential/Cascade | 2-4 thoughts based on complexity |
| **Improve ($i)** | Cascade | 3-5+ thoughts with branches |

**Content Complexity Triggers:**
- **Mixed audiences** → Cascade Thinking
- **Campaign narratives** → Cascade Thinking
- **Simple edits** → Sequential Thinking
- **Framework application** → Sequential Thinking

.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Embrace the Interactive Default
Let the system guide you to discover:
- Hidden failures worth sharing

$vulnerable share our pricing experiment disaster
$collaborative celebrate the team win
$data show conversion improvements
```

### 3. Trust the Frameworks
System intelligently selects based on your content:
- Quick insight → SVC
- Campaign story → CASE
- Process journey → PATH
- Full narrative → STORY

### 4. Celebrate Failures
Best content includes:
- "Spent 6 months on the wrong approach"
- "Our intern caught what we all missed"
- "Still not sure why this works"
- "The ugly version converted better"

### 5. Watch the Visual Progress
```
Understanding: ████████░░ 82% ↗
Next unlock: Share team insight → ⭐ Achievement
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Transform to Any Brand Voice

Use the system's flexibility to adapt:
```
Transform into [YOUR BRAND] voice:
- Keep Voice Trinity structure (50/30/20 split)
- Adapt failures to [YOUR INDUSTRY]
- Replace marketing focus with [YOUR DOMAIN]
- Maintain systematic imperfections
- Preserve celebration mechanics
```

.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Content Issues
- **Too polished**: Natural imperfections not showing → Check frequency (1 per 300-400 words)
- **Missing story**: Use interactive mode to dig deeper with guided questions
- **Wrong audience**: System will auto-detect from keywords
- **Low VEST score**: Use $improve mode for automatic enhancement

### MCP Issues
- **Tools not showing**: Restart Claude Desktop after config
- **Docker errors**: Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- **Cascade not working**: Check repository is cloned correctly
