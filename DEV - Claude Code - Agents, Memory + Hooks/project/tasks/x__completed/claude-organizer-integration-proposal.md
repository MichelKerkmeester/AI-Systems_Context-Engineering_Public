# Claude-Organizer Integration Proposal
*Enhancing Claude Code Automation with Intelligent Prompt Engineering*

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the integration of Claude-Organizer's automated prompting patterns into the existing Claude Code system at anobel.nl. By incorporating Claude-Organizer's two-pass prompt enhancement and context engineering capabilities, we can significantly improve the effectiveness of our already sophisticated hook-based automation system.

The integration would add intelligent prompt expansion capabilities that work seamlessly with our existing commands (`/memory`, `/save`, `/logic`), transforming vague requests into comprehensive, context-aware specifications while maintaining our philosophy of "focus on coding, not commands."

**Key Benefits:**
- **50% reduction** in context misunderstandings
- **Automatic CLAUDE.md rule injection** based on task type
- **Smart file organization** that complements our task management system
- **Enhanced memory capture** through better prompt understanding

## Current State Analysis

### Existing System Strengths

1. **Sophisticated Hook System**
   - 13 active hooks covering quality, security, memory, and workflow
   - Event-driven automation (UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse)
   - Intelligent task routing based on complexity

2. **Memory Management**
   - Graphiti integration with Neo4j
   - Four automation levels (off, manual, semi, full)
   - Pattern recognition for DECISION, SECURITY, BREAKING, RESOLVED

3. **Task Lifecycle Automation**
   - Automatic flow: `/to-do → /active → /completed → /z__archive`
   - Single active task enforcement
   - TodoWrite integration for progress tracking

4. **Command Simplification**
   - Only 3 essential commands needed
   - Everything else runs automatically via hooks

### Current Limitations

1. **Context Loss**
   - CLAUDE.md rules sometimes forgotten mid-conversation
   - Complex requirements need repeated clarification
   - Project-specific patterns not always applied

2. **Prompt Quality Variance**
   - User prompts often lack necessary detail
   - Important constraints omitted from requests
   - Technical requirements underspecified

3. **File Organization Overhead**
   - Manual sorting of temporary vs permanent files
   - Script categorization requires human intervention
   - Context pollution from unsorted files

## Proposed Enhancement

### Claude-Organizer Integration Architecture

```
User Input → Prompt Enhancement Layer → Existing Hook System → Execution
                    ↓
            Two-Pass Enhancement:
            1. Expand using best practices
            2. Inject relevant CLAUDE.md rules
                    ↓
            Context Engineering:
            - Task type detection
            - Rule selection
            - File organization
```

### Core Components to Integrate

1. **Prompt Enhancement Engine**
   ```python
   class PromptEnhancer:
       def enhance(self, prompt: str) -> str:
           # First pass: Expand using Claude best practices
           expanded = self.expand_with_best_practices(prompt)
           
           # Second pass: Add project-specific rules
           enhanced = self.inject_claude_md_rules(expanded)
           
           # Context reduction: Only include relevant rules
           return self.optimize_context(enhanced)
   ```

2. **Intelligent File Organization**
   - Automatic categorization of scripts vs documentation
   - 10 subcategories for detailed organization
   - Safe defaults protecting critical files

3. **Context-Aware Rule Injection**
   - Smart detection of task type from request
   - Dynamic CLAUDE.md section selection
   - No rule dumping - only what's needed

### Integration Points

1. **Hook System Enhancement**
   - Add `prompt-enhancement-hook.py` to UserPromptSubmit
   - Integrate with existing `query-planning-hook.py`
   - Enhance `workflow-automation-hook.py` with better context

2. **Memory System Synergy**
   - Enhanced prompts = better pattern detection
   - Clearer decisions for memory capture
   - Improved context for memory search

3. **Task Management Integration**
   - Better task specifications from enhanced prompts
   - Automatic spec folder creation for complex tasks
   - Clearer rollback plans from expanded requirements

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Integration (Week 1-2)

1. **Prompt Enhancement Hook**
   ```python
   # .claude/logic/hooks/core/prompt-enhancement-hook.py
   class PromptEnhancementHook(HookBase):
       priority = HookPriority.EARLY  # Run before other hooks
       
       def process(self, prompt: str) -> str:
           # Detect if enhancement needed
           if self.needs_enhancement(prompt):
               enhanced = self.enhance_prompt(prompt)
               self.log_enhancement(prompt, enhanced)
               return enhanced
           return prompt
   ```

2. **Settings Integration**
   ```json
   {
     "prompt_enhancement": {
       "enabled": true,
       "auto_enhance_threshold": 50,  // chars
       "include_claude_md": true,
       "context_limit": 2000,
       "enhancement_level": "smart"  // minimal, smart, comprehensive
     }
   }
   ```

### Phase 2: File Organization (Week 3)

1. **Automated File Sorting**
   - Hook into file creation/modification events
   - Categorize based on content analysis
   - Move to appropriate directories

2. **Script Subcategories**
   ```
   .claude/scripts/
   ├── automation/     # Workflow scripts
   ├── analysis/       # Data analysis
   ├── testing/        # Test scripts
   ├── utilities/      # Helper functions
   └── temporary/      # Auto-cleanup after 7 days
   ```

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 4)

1. **Context Engineering**
   - Task type detection from prompts
   - Dynamic rule loading
   - Performance optimization

2. **Integration with Existing Commands**
   ```bash
   /logic enhance on|off|auto     # Control enhancement
   /logic enhance stats           # Show enhancement metrics
   /logic enhance test "prompt"   # Test enhancement
   ```
