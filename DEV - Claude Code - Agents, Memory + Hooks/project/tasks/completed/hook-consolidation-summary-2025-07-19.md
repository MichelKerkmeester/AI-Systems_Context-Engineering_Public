# Hook Directory Consolidation

**Date:** 2025-07-19  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Summary

Successfully consolidated the duplicate hook directory structure by moving all hooks from `.claude/hooks/` to `.claude/logic/hooks/` and merging the shared utilities into `.claude/logic/shared/`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure

**Before:**
```
.claude/
├── hooks/                    # Duplicate location
│   ├── core/
│   ├── memory/
│   ├── quality/
│   ├── session/
│   ├── shared/              # Hook utilities
│   └── tools/
└── logic/
    └── shared/              # Symlinks + multi-agent files
```

**After:**
```
.claude/
└── logic/
    ├── hooks/               # All hooks consolidated here
    │   ├── core/
    │   ├── memory/
    │   ├── quality/
    │   ├── session/
    │   └── tools/
    └── shared/              # All shared utilities (hooks + multi-agent)
```

### 2. Import Updates

All hook imports were updated from:
```python
from hooks.shared import HookBase
```

To:
```python
from logic.shared import HookBase
```

### 3. Path Resolution

Updated sys.path manipulation in all hooks:
```python
# Add parent directories to path for imports
claude_path = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[3]  # Get to .claude directory
sys.path.insert(0, str(claude_path))
```

### 4. Settings.json

Updated all hook paths from `.claude/hooks/` to `.claude/logic/hooks/`:
```json
"command": "python3 '/path/to/.claude/logic/hooks/category/hook-name.py'"
```

## Benefits

1. **Single source of truth** - All logic-related code now in logic/ directory
2. **No more symlinks** - Removed symlink complexity
3. **Cleaner structure** - Easier to understand and navigate
4. **Multi-agent compatible** - Preserved multi-agent files in logic/shared

## Testing

Tested key hooks after consolidation:
- ✅ memory-context-hook.py - Pattern detection working
- ✅ session-hook.py - No errors
- ✅ post-tool-use-memory.py - Fixed initialization issue

## Backup

Created backup before changes:
- Location: `.claude/hooks_backup_20250719_181046`
- Can be restored if needed

## Notes for Multi-Agent Development

The multi-agent system files remain in `.claude/logic/shared/`:
- agent_base.py
- agent_registry.py
- conflict_resolver.py
- distributed_lock_manager.py
- message_queue.py
- resource_monitor.py
- work_distribution.py

These were not affected by the consolidation and continue to work as before.
