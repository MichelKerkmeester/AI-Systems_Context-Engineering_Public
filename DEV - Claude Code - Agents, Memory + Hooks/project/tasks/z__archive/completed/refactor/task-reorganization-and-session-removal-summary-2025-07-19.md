# Task Reorganization and Session Removal Summary

**Date:** 2025-07-19  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Summary

Reorganized completed task summaries into project-based sub-folders and removed all session-related logic from the system, as tasks now handle this functionality.

## Part 1: Task Reorganization

### Created Sub-folder Structure:
```

├── documentation/
│   ├── documentation-location-fixes-summary-2025-07-19.md
│   └── documentation-organization-automation-summary.md
├── memory/

├── multi-agent/

    └── task-reorganization-and-session-removal-summary-2025-07-19.md
```

### Benefits:
- Easier to find related summaries
- Clear project categorization
- Scalable structure for future tasks

## Part 2: Session Removal

### Components Removed:

1. **Hooks:**
   - Deleted `/logic/hooks/session/` directory
   - Removed `session-hook.py`
   - Removed `session-settings.json`

2. **Settings.json:**
   - Removed PreToolUse entry for session-hook
   - Removed PostToolUse entry for session-hook

3. **Shared Components:**
   - Removed `SessionStateManager` class from `hook_state.py`
   - Updated `__init__.py` to remove SessionStateManager imports
   - Kept only `FileTracker` and `TestTracker` classes

4. **Session Data:**
   - Archived to `.claude/z__archive/sessions-backup-2025-07-19/`
   - Removed `/project/sessions/` directory structure

5. **Hook Updates:**
   - Disabled `pattern-extraction-hook.py` (depended on sessions)
   - Added note that pattern extraction is now handled by memory hooks

### Why Remove Sessions?

- Tasks already provide work tracking functionality
- Sessions created redundancy and confusion
- Simpler system with single source of truth
- Tasks provide better organization with sub-folders

## Impact

- Cleaner, more focused system architecture
- No overlapping functionality between tasks and sessions
- All work tracking now unified under task management
- Pattern extraction moved to memory automation hooks

## Migration Notes

- Session data archived but not deleted (in z__archive)
- Pattern extraction functionality can be reimplemented using tasks if needed
- All session-based workflows should now use task management
