```

### Cost Optimization Strategies:

1. **Tiered Processing**: Use Gemini Flash for initial classification, escalate to Claude for complex tasks
2. **Caching**: Leverage Claude's 90% cache discount for repeated contexts
3. **Batch Processing**: Use Kimi K2 on Groq for high-volume, simple tasks
4. **Self-Hosting**: Consider QWEN 3 for predictable workloads

### Latency Optimization:

1. **Parallel Processing**: Use multiple Kimi K2 instances for parallelizable tasks
2. **Streaming**: All models support streaming for perceived latency reduction
3. **Precomputation**: Use Gemini Flash to pre-process and cache common patterns

## Key Architectural Insights

1. **No Single Best Model**: Each excels in specific scenarios
2. **Speed vs. Quality Tradeoff**: Gemini Flash is 10x faster but less accurate than Claude
3. **Context Window Advantage**: Gemini's 1M tokens enables new architectural patterns
4. **Cost Differentials**: 40x price difference between cheapest and most expensive
5. **Latency Spectrum**: From 0.1s (Kimi/Groq) to 2s (Claude) first token

## Recommended Agent Architecture

For a production agent system, implement a **multi-model strategy**:

1. **Router Agent** (Gemini Flash): Classifies requests and routes to appropriate model
2. **Execution Agents**: 
   - Simple queries → Kimi K2
   - Complex reasoning → Claude Sonnet 3.5
   - Code generation → QWEN 3 or Claude
   - Document processing → Gemini Flash
3. **Fallback Strategy**: Each agent has a designated backup model
4. **Cost Control**: Set budgets and automatically downgrade to cheaper models when exceeded

This architecture provides the best balance of performance, cost, and reliability for diverse agent workloads.
