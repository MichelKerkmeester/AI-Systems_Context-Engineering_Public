# Superdesign Canvas Integration Summary

## Can We Use Superdesign's Canvas in Claude Code?

**Direct Integration**: ❌ No - Superdesign is a VSCode extension, Claude Code is a CLI tool

**Adapted Integration**: ✅ Yes - We can build a canvas viewer using the same concepts

## How the Integration Works

### 1. **Canvas Viewer Architecture**
Instead of a VSCode extension, we create a local web application that:
- Runs on your machine via Vite dev server
- Opens in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/canvas`
- Watches the `.claude-designs/` directory for changes
- Updates in real-time as Claude Code generates designs

### 2. **Key Features We Can Adapt**
- ✅ Infinite canvas with pan/zoom
- ✅ Grid and hierarchy layouts
- ✅ Multiple design iterations
- ✅ Responsive viewport switching
- ✅ Design relationships/versioning
- ✅ Export capabilities

### 3. **Implementation Strategy**
We extend your existing viteflow components:
- **canvasViewer.js** - Main canvas (extends exampleComponent pattern)
- **canvasControls.js** - Control panel (reuses stateModal drawer)
- **canvasFrame.js** - Design frames (adapts stateCard)
- **designWatcher.js** - File monitoring via Vite plugin

### 4. **Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Start canvas viewer
claude-code canvas

# 2. In another terminal, generate designs
claude-code "Create a hero section with gradient background"

# 3. Designs appear instantly in canvas viewer
# 4. Pan, zoom, compare, and export designs
```

### 5. **What Gets Reused**
From your codebase:
- Viteflow component architecture
- GSAP animations
- Modal/drawer patterns
- Build system (Vite)

From Superdesign concepts:
- Canvas interaction patterns
- Design file structure
- Layout algorithms
- Frame management

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No New Dependencies** - Uses your existing tech stack
2. **Familiar Patterns** - Extends components you already have
3. **CLI-Friendly** - Works perfectly with Claude Code
4. **Real-time Updates** - See designs as they generate
5. **Version Control** - Git-friendly file structure

## Limitations vs Original Superdesign

- No direct IDE integration (opens in browser instead)
- No Cursor-specific features
- Manual canvas launch (not automatic)
- Requires running local server

## Next Steps

1. **Review Spec** - Check requirements.md for details
2. **Approve Design** - Verify approach in design.md
3. **Move to Active** - Begin implementation
4. **Test Integration** - Follow test-plan.md

## Memory Capture
This integration spec demonstrates successful code reuse analysis, identifying 4 existing components to extend rather than creating new ones. The approach adapts external tool concepts (Superdesign) for CLI usage while maintaining architectural consistency with the existing viteflow system.
