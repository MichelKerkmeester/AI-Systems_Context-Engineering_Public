UltraThink ThinkHarder\n\nPlease provide well-commented, production-ready code following the project's coding standards.\n\n## Project Coding Principles:\n- 1. **Elite JavaScript & CSS specialist** - Fix root causes, not symptoms\n- 2. **Production-grade code** - DRY, KISS, secure, performant\n- 3. **Webflow enhancement** - Work with platform, never against it\n- 4. **Full ownership** - Complete solutions, not patches\n\n## Task Management:\n- Create spec folder for major changes\n- Active task limit: 1\n- Task flow: specs \u2192 active \u2192 completed\n\n## Automation Info:\n- Most commands run automatically via hooks\n- Essential commands: /memory, /save, /logic\n- Check automation status: /logic hooks status\n\n## Production Checklist:\n- [ ] ] No console.log statements\n- [ ] ] No hardcoded API keys\n- [ ] ] All tests passing\n- [ ] ] Performance budgets met\n- [ ] ] Security scan clean",
