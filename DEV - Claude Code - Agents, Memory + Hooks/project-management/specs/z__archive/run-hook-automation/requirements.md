# Run Hook Automation Requirements

## Overview
The `run-hook.py` file appears to be a simple test runner for hooks. We should evaluate whether this functionality is needed and how it could be better integrated into the system.

## Current State
- Location: `.claude/logic/hooks/code_reuse/run-hook.py`
- Purpose: Test runner that forwards execution to `code-reuse-validation-hook.py`
- Not currently in `settings.json` (not automated)
- Simple wrapper script with minimal functionality

## Requirements

### Option 1: Remove the File
If this is just a test utility that's no longer needed:
1. Remove `run-hook.py` entirely
2. Ensure `code-reuse-validation-hook.py` works independently
3. No automation needed

### Option 2: Convert to Hook Testing Framework
Transform into a comprehensive hook testing utility:
1. **Test All Hooks**: Extend to test any hook, not just code-reuse
2. **Mock Data Support**: Provide test data for different hook types
3. **Validation**: Check hook outputs and error handling
4. **Integration**: Add as a `/logic hooks test` command

### Option 3: Integrate into Development Workflow
Make it part of the automated development process:
1. **Pre-commit Testing**: Run before allowing commits
2. **Hook Validation**: Ensure hooks meet requirements
3. **Performance Testing**: Monitor hook execution times
4. **Add to PreToolUse**: Validate hooks before they execute

## Recommendation
**Remove the file** (Option 1). The functionality is too limited and specific to justify automation. The code-reuse-validation-hook already runs automatically via settings.json, making this wrapper redundant.

## Decision Criteria
- Does it provide unique value? No - it's just a wrapper
- Is it used frequently? No evidence of regular use
- Does it solve a real problem? Hook testing can be done directly
- Maintenance burden? Low, but unnecessary

## Next Steps
1. Verify `code-reuse-validation-hook.py` works without this wrapper
2. Check for any dependencies on `run-hook.py`
3. Remove the file if no dependencies found
4. Update documentation if needed
