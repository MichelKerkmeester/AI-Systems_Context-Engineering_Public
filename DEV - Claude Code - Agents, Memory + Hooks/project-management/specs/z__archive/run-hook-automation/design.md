# Run Hook Design Decision

## Decision: Remove the File

After analyzing the `run-hook.py` file, the decision is to **remove it entirely** rather than automate it.

## Rationale

### 1. Redundant Functionality
- The file is a simple wrapper that forwards to `code-reuse-validation-hook.py`
- The actual hook is already automated in `settings.json`
- No unique functionality that justifies keeping it

### 2. Testing Can Be Done Directly
```bash
# Current approach (unnecessary wrapper)
python3 run-hook.py

# Direct approach (simpler)
python3 code-reuse-validation-hook.py --test
```

### 3. No Evidence of Active Use
- Not referenced in any documentation
- Not included in automation settings
- Appears to be leftover from development/testing

### 4. Violates DRY Principle
- Creates unnecessary indirection
- Adds maintenance burden without value
- Could confuse future developers

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Verify No Dependencies
```bash
grep -r "run-hook.py" .claude/
```

### Step 2: Check Hook Independence
Ensure `code-reuse-validation-hook.py` has its own test mode

### Step 3: Remove File
```bash
rm .claude/logic/hooks/code_reuse/run-hook.py
```

### Step 4: Update Documentation
If any references exist, update them to point directly to the validation hook

## Alternative Approach (If Removal Blocked)

If we discover the file is needed, convert it to a general hook testing utility:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Universal hook testing framework"""

def test_hook(hook_path, test_data=None):
    """Test any hook with mock data"""
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

But this should be a new file with a clear purpose, not a repurposed wrapper.

## Conclusion
The file provides no value in its current form. Removal is the cleanest solution that aligns with our code quality standards.
