# Prompt Improver Testing Plan

## 🎯 Testing Objectives

1. **Verify Automation**: Confirm that prompts are automatically enhanced without user intervention
2. **Test Enhancement Quality**: Validate that enhanced prompts include project rules and best practices
3. **Check Bypass Mechanisms**: Ensure bypass prefixes (`raw:`, `exact:`, `no-enhance:`) work correctly
4. **Validate Enhancement Levels**: Test minimal, moderate, and aggressive enhancement modes
5. **Performance Impact**: Measure impact on response time
6. **Edge Cases**: Test with various prompt types and edge conditions

## 📋 Test Categories

### 1. Basic Enhancement Tests
Test that simple prompts are enhanced with context and rules

#### Test Cases:
1. **Simple Code Request**
   - Input: `create a button`
   - Expected: Enhanced with Webflow context, CLAUDE.md rules, REM units requirement

2. **Debugging Request**
   - Input: `fix the error`
   - Expected: Enhanced with specific debugging approach, error context requirements

3. **Vague Request**
   - Input: `help me`
   - Expected: Enhanced with clarification request, context gathering

### 2. Rule Injection Tests
Verify that CLAUDE.md rules are properly injected

#### Test Cases:
1. **CSS Request**
   - Input: `style this element`
   - Expected: Must include REM units reminder, no pixels

2. **JavaScript Request**
   - Input: `add console logging`
   - Expected: Must include no console.log rule, suggest alternatives

3. **File Creation Request**
   - Input: `create a new component`
   - Expected: Must include "edit existing files" preference

### 3. Bypass Mechanism Tests
Ensure bypass prefixes work correctly

#### Test Cases:
1. **Raw Prefix**
   - Input: `raw: console.log('test')`
   - Expected: No enhancement, exact prompt passed through

2. **Exact Prefix**
   - Input: `exact: SELECT * FROM users`
   - Expected: No enhancement, SQL query unchanged

3. **Command Bypass**
   - Input: `/memory search patterns`
   - Expected: Commands should not be enhanced

### 4. Enhancement Level Tests
Test different enhancement levels

#### Test Cases:
1. **Minimal Enhancement**
   - Settings: `enhancement_level: "minimal"`
   - Input: `add validation`
   - Expected: Light touch, only essential clarifications

2. **Moderate Enhancement**
   - Settings: `enhancement_level: "moderate"`
   - Input: `add validation`
   - Expected: Context added, relevant rules injected

3. **Aggressive Enhancement**
   - Settings: `enhancement_level: "aggressive"`
   - Input: `add validation`
   - Expected: Comprehensive context, checklists, alternatives

### 5. Context Detection Tests
Test prompt type detection accuracy

#### Test Cases:
1. **Code Generation Detection**
   - Input: `create a modal component`
   - Expected: Detected as `code_generation`

2. **Debugging Detection**
   - Input: `why is this not working?`
   - Expected: Detected as `debugging`

3. **Review Detection**
   - Input: `review this code for security`
   - Expected: Detected as `code_review`

### 6. Edge Case Tests
Test unusual scenarios

#### Test Cases:
1. **Very Long Prompt**
   - Input: 10,000+ character prompt
   - Expected: Should bypass enhancement (max_prompt_length)

2. **Code Block Only**
   - Input: ` ```js\nfunction test() {}\n``` `
   - Expected: Should bypass enhancement

3. **Mixed Content**
   - Input: `Here's my code: [code] can you fix it?`
   - Expected: Should enhance the text part, preserve code

### 7. Integration Tests
Test with actual Claude Code workflow

#### Test Cases:
1. **Full Workflow Test**
   - Create a simple prompt
   - Verify enhancement notice appears
   - Check that enhanced prompt is used
   - Validate response quality improvement

2. **Multi-Turn Conversation**
   - Test that enhancement persists across turns
   - Verify context accumulation
   - Check pattern learning

## 🚀 Parallel Test Execution Strategy

We'll use 5 parallel agents to speed up testing:

1. **Agent 1**: Basic Enhancement & Rule Injection Tests
2. **Agent 2**: Bypass Mechanism Tests
3. **Agent 3**: Enhancement Level Tests
4. **Agent 4**: Context Detection Tests
5. **Agent 5**: Edge Cases & Integration Tests

Each agent will:
- Run their assigned test cases
- Log results in a standardized format
- Report back with enhancement examples
- Note any failures or unexpected behavior

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ 100% of prompts enhanced (except bypassed)
- ✅ All CLAUDE.md rules properly injected
- ✅ Bypass mechanisms work reliably
- ✅ Enhancement levels produce distinct results
- ✅ No performance degradation > 100ms
- ✅ Pattern learning captures successful enhancements

### Failure Indicators:
- ❌ Prompts passing through unenhanced
- ❌ Rules not being injected
- ❌ Bypass prefixes being enhanced
- ❌ Enhancement causing errors
- ❌ Significant performance impact

## 🧪 Test Data Collection

For each test, we'll collect:
1. **Original Prompt**: The input text
2. **Enhanced Prompt**: The output after enhancement
3. **Enhancement Metadata**:
   - Prompt type detected
   - Rules applied
   - Patterns matched
   - Confidence score
   - Processing time
4. **Validation Result**: Pass/Fail with reason

## 📝 Test Result Format

```json
