# Next Steps - Production Testing & Validation

**Status**: ACTIVE ROADMAP  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - SYSTEM NEVER TESTED WITH REAL MCP CALLS  
**Timeline**: Test immediately, then 1-2 weeks to completion  

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Test Agent System with Real MCP Operations

### The Problem
The agent system has been built but **never actually tested with real MCP calls**. We need to validate that the orchestrator properly routes tasks to different models and that MCP integrations work correctly.

### Immediate Test Plan

#### 1. Test Basic MCP Operations Through Agents
```bash
# Test 1: Simple file operation via Gemini
"Fix the typo 'recieve' to 'receive' in README.md"
# Expected: Routes to Gemini Flash, uses mcp__github-mcp-server__get_file_contents

# Test 2: Complex implementation via QWEN3
"Create a new React component for user authentication with JWT"
# Expected: Routes to QWEN3-Coder, multiple MCP calls

# Test 3: Code analysis via Gemini
"Analyze the codebase and find all console.log statements"
# Expected: Routes to Gemini Flash, uses mcp__code-context__search_code
```

#### 2. Verify MCP Integration Points
- [ ] **GitHub MCP**: File operations, PR creation
- [ ] **Code Context MCP**: Semantic search
- [ ] **Graphiti MCP**: Memory storage
- [ ] **Browser MCPs**: Web research tasks
- [ ] **Sequential Thinking**: Complex reasoning
