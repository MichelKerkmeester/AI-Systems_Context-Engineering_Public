# Spec Sub-folder Automation Implementation

**Task:** Implement automatic sub-folder organization for specs
**Completion Date:** January 21, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All tests passing

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Successfully implemented automatic sub-folder organization for the `/specs` directory, matching the system already in place for `/completed`. Now when tasks are created, they are automatically placed in appropriate sub-folders based on their type (features, bugs, enhancements, etc.), ensuring consistent organization from creation through completion.

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. Updated TaskManager (task_manager.py)
- ✅ Added `_determine_task_subfolder()` method to categorize tasks
- ✅ Modified `create_task()` to create tasks in sub-folders
- ✅ Updated `activate_task()` to search within sub-folders
- ✅ Enhanced `complete_task()` to maintain sub-folder organization
- ✅ Updated `search_tasks()` to use recursive search (rglob)

### 2. Updated Query Planning Hook
- ✅ Updated lifecycle description to show sub-folder organization
- ✅ Added message about automatic organization
- ✅ Clarified that specs are organized just like completed tasks

### 3. Updated Task Management Hook  
- ✅ Modified task creation guidance to show sub-folder location
- ✅ Updated workflow diagram to include category placeholders
- ✅ Added comprehensive list of common categories

### 4. Created Standard Sub-folders
Created the following sub-folders in `/specs`:
- `features/` - New functionality
- `bugs/` - Bug fixes and issues
- `enhancements/` - Improvements and upgrades
- `refactoring/` - Code restructuring
- `documentation/` - Docs and guides
- `testing/` - Test specifications
- `security/` - Security-related specs
- `performance/` - Performance improvements
- `integrations/` - Third-party integrations
- `general/` - Tasks that don't fit other categories

## 🧪 Testing Results

Successfully tested automatic categorization:
```
✅ implement-user-authentication → /specs/features/
✅ fix-login-timeout-bug → /specs/bugs/
✅ enhance-dashboard-performance → /specs/enhancements/
✅ refactor-api-client → /specs/refactoring/
✅ update-api-documentation → /specs/enhancements/
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Categorization Logic
The system analyzes task names for keywords:
```python
Categories:
- "feature", "add", "implement", "create" → features/
- "bug", "fix", "issue", "error" → bugs/
- "enhance", "improve", "upgrade" → enhancements/
- "refactor", "clean", "reorganize" → refactoring/
- "doc", "readme", "guide" → documentation/
```

### File Discovery
The system now searches recursively through sub-folders when:
- Activating tasks from specs
- Searching for tasks
- Completing tasks

## 📁 Complete Task Lifecycle

```
1. Created:    /specs/features/new-feature.md
2. Activated:  /active/new-feature.md
3. Completed:  /completed/features/2025-01-21-new-feature.md
4. Archived:   /z__archive/features/... (user-managed only)
```

## 🎓 Benefits

1. **Consistent Organization**: Tasks are organized from creation, not just after completion
2. **Easy Discovery**: Related specs are grouped together
3. **Clear Categories**: Standard categories help with classification
4. **Automatic Process**: No manual organization needed
5. **Maintains History**: Sub-folder structure preserved through lifecycle

**Note:** This implementation ensures that task organization is consistent throughout the entire lifecycle, from initial specification through to archival.
