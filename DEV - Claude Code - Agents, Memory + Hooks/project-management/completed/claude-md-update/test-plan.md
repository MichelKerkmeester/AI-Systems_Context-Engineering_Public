### 2. Hook Compatibility Tests

#### Pre-update Hooks
- [ ] Test backup creation before updates
- [ ] Verify diff generation works
- [ ] Validate version tracking
- [ ] Confirm rollback preparation

#### Post-update Hooks
- [ ] Test validation after updates

- [ ] Confirm notification system

#### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test with quality-check.js active
- [ ] Verify security-scan.js compatibility
- [ ] Validate memory-capture.js integration
- [ ] Test pattern-extraction.js behavior

### 3. Command Testing

#### Memory Commands
```bash
# Test each variant
/memory search "test query"
/memory manual
/memory auto
```

#### Logic Commands
```bash
# Test help system
/logic help
/logic help automation
/logic help hooks
/logic help migration
/logic help troubleshooting
/logic help code-reuse

# Test hook status
/logic hooks status

# Test emergency controls
/logic emergency disable
/logic emergency enable
```

### 4. Automation Flow Testing

#### Automatic Spec Creation
1. Create request with complexity ≥ 6
2. Verify spec folder auto-creation
3. Check all required files generated
4. Validate code reuse analysis included

#### Memory Auto-capture
1. Trigger each auto-capture scenario
2. Verify memories are created
3. Check capture format compliance
4. Validate group_id assignment

#### Hook Execution Order
1. Make file edit
2. Verify pre-hook runs first
3. Check main action execution
4. Validate post-hook completion

### 5. Self-update Mechanism Testing

#### Update Detection
- [ ] Test manual update trigger
- [ ] Verify automatic detection
- [ ] Validate version comparison
- [ ] Check update frequency limits

#### Update Process
- [ ] Test backup creation
- [ ] Verify safe update application
- [ ] Validate rollback capability
- [ ] Check notification system

#### Conflict Resolution
- [ ] Test with local modifications
- [ ] Verify merge strategies
- [ ] Validate manual intervention prompts
- [ ] Check conflict logging

## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Unit Tests
1. Test individual sections in isolation
2. Verify each command independently
3. Test hooks one at a time
4. Duration: 30 minutes

### Phase 2: Integration Tests
1. Test section interactions
2. Verify command combinations
3. Test hook chains
4. Duration: 45 minutes

### Phase 3: End-to-End Tests
1. Complete workflow testing
2. Multi-user scenario testing
3. Stress testing with rapid updates
4. Duration: 60 minutes

### Phase 4: Edge Cases
1. Corrupted CLAUDE.md handling
2. Network failure during update
3. Simultaneous update attempts
4. Permission issues
5. Duration: 45 minutes

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- All commands execute without errors
- Hooks trigger at appropriate times
- Memory operations complete successfully
- Updates apply without data loss

### Performance Requirements
- Commands respond within 2 seconds
- Updates complete within 10 seconds
- No noticeable lag in normal operations
- Memory usage stays under 100MB

### Reliability Requirements
- 99.9% uptime for core functionality
- Graceful degradation on failures
- Automatic recovery mechanisms work
- Data integrity maintained

## Test Data

### Sample CLAUDE.md Modifications
```markdown
# Test insertion at line 10
New content for testing

# Test deletion at line 50
[Lines to be removed]

# Test modification at line 100
Updated content here
```

### Expected Outputs
- Backup file created: `.claude/backups/CLAUDE.md.backup.[timestamp]`
- Diff file generated: `.claude/diffs/CLAUDE.md.diff.[timestamp]`
- Update log entry: `.claude/logs/updates.log`

## Automated Test Scripts

### Basic Functionality Test
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-claude-md.sh

echo "Testing CLAUDE.md update system..."

# Test 1: Backup creation
cp CLAUDE.md CLAUDE.md.test
echo "Test content" >> CLAUDE.md
# Trigger update mechanism
# Verify backup exists

# Test 2: Command execution
/memory search "test"
/logic help

# Test 3: Hook compatibility
# Make file edit to trigger hooks
echo "test" > test-file.js
rm test-file.js

echo "Tests complete. Check logs for results."
```
