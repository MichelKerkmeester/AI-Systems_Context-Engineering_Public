# Neo4j Integration Test Summary

## Test Results (2025-01-22)

### 1. Neo4j Database Status
- ✅ Neo4j is running on localhost:7687
- ✅ Authentication successful with provided credentials
- ✅ Database "memory" exists and is online
- ❌ Database is empty (0 nodes)

### 2. Graphiti MCP Server
- ❌ Cannot add episodes via MCP tool
- Error: `Unable to get a routing table for database 'neo4j'`
- Issue: MCP server appears to be trying to connect to database "neo4j" instead of "memory"
- Configuration shows NEO4J_DATABASE="memory" but error suggests it's being ignored

### 3. Crawl4AI MCP Server
- ⚠️ parse_github_to_neo4j tool not found in MCP interface
- The tool exists in the knowledge_graphs module but may not be exposed via MCP

### 4. Root Cause Analysis
The Graphiti MCP server has a database routing issue where it's trying to connect to a non-existent "neo4j" database instead of the configured "memory" database. This appears to be a bug in how the Neo4j driver is initialized in the MCP server.

### 5. Recommendations
1. The Graphiti MCP server needs to be fixed to properly use the NEO4J_DATABASE environment variable
2. The Crawl4AI repository parsing functionality may need to be exposed as an MCP tool
3. Both services are configured correctly but have implementation issues preventing proper database updates
