## üéØ Resolution Checklist Philosophy (NEW)

The v4.1.0 update revolutionizes how Resolution Checklists work:

### Core Changes
- **Think in work streams**, not tasks
- **Maximum 3 items per section**
- **Each checkbox = meaningful deliverable**
- **Focus on WHAT gets delivered**, not HOW
- **Each item represents 2-8 hours minimum work**

### Sizing by Mode

| Mode | Total Sections | Items per Section | Total Items |
|------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Quick** | 2-3 | 2-3 | 4-6 |
| **Standard** | 4-5 | 2-3 | 8-12 |
| **Complex** | 6-8 | 2-3 | 12-20 |

### Example Transformation

**Old Style (Too Detailed):**
```markdown
### Frontend Implementation
- [ ] Create Button.tsx component
- [ ] Add hover state styles
- [ ] Add active state styles
- [ ] Add disabled state styles
- [ ] Import design tokens
- [ ] Set up onClick handlers
- [ ] Add loading spinner
```

**New Style (Global Outcome):**
```markdown
### Component Development
- [ ] Build Button component with all states
- [ ] Add complete test coverage
- [ ] Integrate with component library
```

## üéØ Interactive Offers

When users specify `$standard` or `$complex`, the system ALWAYS offers Interactive assistance first:

```markdown
User: $s user authentication

System: I see you want a standard ticket for user authentication.

Would you like me to:
1. **Guide you through creating it interactively** - I'll ask questions to ensure we capture everything
2. **Create it directly** - I'll use my best judgment

Which would you prefer? (1 or 2)
```

This ensures users get the best possible ticket quality while respecting their autonomy.

## üéõÔ∏è Operating Modes

| Mode | Command | When to Use | Resolution Sections | Interactive Offer | Focus |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Interactive** | DEFAULT | No mode specified, guidance needed | Adaptive | N/A (Default) | Conversational guidance |
| **Quick** | `$q` | Simple features (explicit) | 2-3 sections | No | Essential requirements |
| **Standard** | `$s` | Full features (explicit) | 4-5 sections | **YES - Always** | Complete context |
| **Complex** | `$c` | Major features/initiatives | 6-8 sections | **YES - Always** | Phases OR child tickets |
| **Spec** | `$spec` | Frontend implementation | N/A | No | Concise code solutions |

**Note:** Interactive mode is the default unless explicitly specified.

## üîß Complex Mode (Enhanced)

Complex mode now offers two approaches for major features:

### Option A: Phased Development
For incremental building of a single large feature:
- Phase 1: Foundation
- Phase 2: Core Features
- Phase 3: Enhancement

### Option B: Child Ticket Breakdown
For multi-team coordination:
- Infrastructure tickets
- Feature implementation tickets
- Quality & polish tickets

The system helps you choose the right approach during ticket creation.

## üíª Spec Mode (Transformed)

The new Spec mode is concise and efficient:

### Fast Paths (0-1 Questions)
```markdown
User: $spec hide scrollbar
System: Browser compatibility needed?
User: yes
[Generates 20-line CSS solution immediately]
```

### Component Patterns (2-3 Questions)
```markdown
User: $spec virtual scroll table
System: Quick setup:
1. Row count?
2. React/Vue?
User: 50k, React
[Generates 40-line working implementation]
```

### Key Features
- **Auto-detection** of common patterns
- **1-3 questions maximum**
- **20-30 lines for simple, 40-60 for complex**
- **Copy-paste ready code**
- **No placeholders or comments**

## üéØ Scope Prefixes

Every ticket title includes a user-specified scope prefix:

| Prefix | Use For | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **[BE]** | Backend features | `# ‚ùñ [BE] User Authentication` |
| **[FE]** | Frontend features | `# ‚ùñ [FE] Dashboard Redesign` |
| **[Mobile]** | Mobile app features | `# ‚ùñ [Mobile] Push Notifications` |
| **[FS]** | Full stack features | `# ‚ùñ [FS] Real-time Chat` |
| **[DevOps]** | Infrastructure | `# ‚ùñ [DevOps] CI/CD Pipeline` |
| **[QA]** | Testing features | `# ‚ùñ [QA] Test Automation` |

**Note:** System asks users to specify scope - never assumes.

## üìù Structured Descriptions

Every ticket uses a concise, structured description format:

```markdown
# ‚ùñ [FE] Advanced Search Filters

Our search functionality is failing to meet user needs and causing lost revenue.

‚ö†Ô∏é **Key problems/changes:**
* **High abandonment rate** - Users give up before finding what they need
* **No filtering options** - Users scroll through irrelevant results
* **Poor relevance** - Basic keyword matching returns unrelated items

‚Åâ **Reasons why:**
By implementing comprehensive filtering capabilities, we'll dramatically improve product discovery and increase conversion.

**User Value:** Find exactly what you need with powerful filters
**Business Goal:** Dramatically reduce search abandonment rate
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Label System

The system asks users to specify appropriate labels:

### Common Label Categories
- **Type**: feature, bug, improvement, technical-debt
- **Component**: authentication, payments, search, UI
- **Priority**: high, medium, low (if your team uses these)

Example:
```markdown
System: What labels should I add to this ticket?
User: feature, search, filters, high-priority
```

## üí¨ Interactive Mode Flow

The default conversational mode:

### Typical Flow
1. User describes feature (no mode specified)
2. System asks about user needs and problems
3. System asks for scope ([BE], [FE], etc.)
4. System asks for labels
5. System asks about success metrics
6. Creates comprehensive ticket with global checklist
7. Delivers with quality dashboard

### Quality Dashboard
```markdown
üìä Interactive Mode Report
Overall Quality Score: 4.5/5 ‚≠ê

‚úÖ Ticket Structure Checklist:
‚úì User value clearly stated
‚úì Scope properly identified: [FS]
‚úì Labels added: feature, search, filters
‚úì Business goal measurable
‚úì Requirements outcome-focused
‚úì Resolution checklist global (max 3 items/section)
‚úì 2-minute read test: PASS (1:45)

üìã Resolution Checklist Quality:
Global Approach   ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà 100%
Outcome Focus     ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë 95%
Section Count     4 sections ‚úì
Items per Section 2-3 items ‚úì
```

## üìã Examples

### Interactive Mode (Default)
```
User: need user profiles
System: [Starts conversation about user needs, then asks for scope and labels]
```

### Standard with Interactive Offer
```
User: $s authentication system

System: [Offers Interactive, then helps choose between phases or child tickets]
```

### Spec Mode (Concise)
```
User: $spec debounced search input
System: React or Vanilla JS?
User: React
System: [Generates 25-line working implementation]
```

## üîß Installing MCP Tools (Recommended)

The system intelligently selects between Sequential and Cascade Thinking based on task complexity. Choose either Docker (stable) or NPX (quick) installation:

### Option A: AI-Powered Docker Setup (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop installed ([Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Claude Desktop app ([Download Claude](https://claude.ai/download))

**AI-Assisted Installation:**

Copy this prompt to Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant:

```
Help me set up Docker containers for the Dev Ticket Writer MCP tools.

I need to:
1. Create a directory at "$HOME/MCP Servers"
2. Clone these repos:
   - https://github.com/sequentialthinking/sequential-thinking-mcp
   - https://github.com/cascadethinking/cascade-thinking-mcp
3. Create a docker-compose.yml file with services for both
4. Configure Claude Desktop's claude_desktop_config.json
5. Start the containers with docker-compose

I'm on [Windows/Mac/Linux]. Please give me the exact commands to run.
```

The AI will provide step-by-step commands for your operating system.

**Verification:**
1. Check Docker Desktop for 2 running containers
2. Look for the üîå icon in Claude Desktop showing available tools
3. Test with: "$q fix login bug"

### Option B: NPX Installation (Quick but Less Stable)

Add to Claude Desktop config file:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    },
    "cascade-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "cascade-thinking-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### MCP Tool Selection

The system intelligently selects thinking tools based on mode:

| Mode | Tool Selection | Thoughts Used |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| **Interactive** | Cascade Thinking | 3-5+ thoughts with branching |
| **Quick ($q)** | Sequential Thinking | 1-3 thoughts for analysis |
| **Standard ($s)** | Sequential Thinking | 1-3 thoughts for analysis |
| **Complex ($c)** | Cascade Thinking | 3-5+ thoughts with branching |
| **Spec ($spec)** | Sequential Thinking | 1-3 thoughts for analysis |

### Figma MCP (Optional)
For UI feature tickets, the system can integrate with Figma to:
- Extract design specifications
- Reference component libraries
- Link to design files

While never required, Figma integration enhances UI-related tickets with direct design references.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Resolution Checklists
- **Too many items?** - Think in work streams, not tasks
- **Too detailed?** - Each item should be a deliverable
- **Not sure how to group?** - Use system layers or feature areas

### Interactive Offers
- **Not seeing offer?** - Only appears for $s and $c modes
- **Want to skip?** - Choose option 2 for direct creation
- **Changed mind?** - System can switch to Interactive mid-flow

### Complex Mode
- **Phases vs Child tickets?** - System helps you choose
- **Too many requirements?** - Consider child ticket approach
- **Need both?** - Hybrid approach possible

### Spec Mode
- **Too many questions?** - Should be 1-3 max
- **Code not working?** - All examples are tested
- **Need more sections?** - Spec mode stays minimal by design

### Scope & Labels
- **Forgot to specify?** - System will ask
- **Wrong scope chosen?** - Be specific about work location
- **Too many labels?** - Keep to 3-5 most relevant

### MCP Connection Issues
- **Docker not running**: Start Docker Desktop
- **Can't connect**: Restart Claude Desktop
- **Wrong directory**: Check you're in "$HOME/MCP Servers"
- **Permission errors**: Run terminal as administrator (Windows) or use sudo (Mac/Linux)

### Common Setup Problems
- **"Command not found"**: Ensure Node.js is installed for NPX method
- **Containers won't start**: Check Docker Desktop is running
- **Tools not showing**: Restart Claude Desktop after config changes
- **Rate limits**: Both tools handle this gracefully with retries

### Getting Help
- For Docker issues: Check container logs in Docker Desktop
- For NPX issues: Check Claude Desktop logs
- For general issues: The AI assistant can help diagnose problems
