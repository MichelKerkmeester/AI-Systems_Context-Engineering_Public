**Second paragraph** covers:
- Proposed solution approach
- Expected benefits
- Technical considerations
- Success indicators

Example:
```markdown
# ‚ùñ [FE] Advanced Search Filters

Our search functionality is failing users, with the majority abandoning searches before finding what they need. Current issues include:

‚Ä¢ **No filtering options** - Users scroll through hundreds of irrelevant results
‚Ä¢ **Poor relevance** - Basic keyword matching returns unrelated items
‚Ä¢ **Mobile frustration** - Search is nearly unusable on small screens

By implementing comprehensive filtering capabilities, we'll dramatically improve product discovery. The solution includes category filters, price ranges, availability toggles, and smart sorting that updates results in real-time, helping users find exactly what they need without frustration.
```

## üéõÔ∏è Operating Modes

| Mode | Command | When to Use | Resolution Checklist | MCP Usage |
|------|---------|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Interactive** | DEFAULT | No mode specified, guidance needed | Adaptive | Cascade (3-5 thoughts) |
| **Quick** | `$q` | Simple features (explicit request) | 3-5 items | Sequential (1-2 thoughts) |
| **Standard** | `$s` | Full features (explicit request) | 8-15 items | Sequential (2-3 thoughts) |
| **Complex** | `$c` | Multi-phase implementations | 15-30 items | Cascade (3-5 thoughts) |
| **Epic** | `$e` | Major initiatives | 10-20 items | Cascade (5+ thoughts) |

**Note:** Interactive mode is the default unless explicitly specified otherwise.

## üè∑Ô∏è Automatic Label Mapping (NEW)

The system automatically assigns labels based on detected content:

| Detected Content | Auto-Applied Labels |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Backend code | `Backend-System`, `API` |
| Frontend UI | `[App]-App`, `UI` |
| Mobile features | `Mobile-App` |
| Authentication | `Authentication`, `Security` |
| Database work | `Database`, `Backend-System` |
| Bug fixes | `bug`, `defect` |
| New features | `feature`, `enhancement` |
| Performance | `performance`, `optimization` |

## üìù How Prompt Improvement Works

The system invisibly enhances vague requests before processing:

### What Gets Enhanced
```
"fix auth" ‚Üí "create bug fix ticket for authentication"
"DB slow" ‚Üí "create performance ticket for database"
"need API docs" ‚Üí "create feature ticket for application programming interface documentation"
```

### Common Developer Abbreviations
- **Technical**: API, DB, UI, UX, FE, BE, auth, config, env, repo
- **Process**: QA, CI/CD, MVP, POC, PR
- **Performance**: perf, opt, mem
- **Security**: sec, vuln, 2FA

### What DOESN'T Change
- Implementation details (never added)
- Priority or complexity (never assumed)
- Mode commands ($q, $s, etc.)
- Already clear requests
- The need for Interactive mode questions

## üèóÔ∏è Core Components

### WHAT/WHY Philosophy
- **WHAT**: Clear description of the feature/fix needed
- **WHY**: User value and business outcomes
- **NOT HOW**: Leave implementation to developers

### Enhanced Symbol System (Required)
- **‚ùñ** - Titles and major features (with H1)
- **‚óá** - Requirements and main sections
- **‚óä** - Sub-headings within sections
- **‚Üí** - Designs & References
- **‚úì** - Success criteria AND Resolution Checklist
- **‚äó** - Dependencies
- **‚Äî** - Sub-categories under **‚óä** sub-headings

### Complete Ticket Structure
1. Title with `# ‚ùñ [SCOPE]` format
2. Rich 1-2 paragraph description
3. User Value statement
4. Business Goal (measurable, no percentages)
5. Requirements (outcome-focused)
   - Use **‚óä** for complex sections
   - Use ‚Äî for sub-categories
6. Technical Details section (NEW)
7. Success Criteria (checkboxes)
8. Resolution Checklist (REQUIRED)
9. Dependencies (if any)
10. Labels (auto-generated)

## üîß Technical Details Section (NEW)

Every ticket includes technical specifics for developers:

```markdown
## ‚óá Technical Details

**‚óä** Architecture
- **Component:** Backend-System (Go)
- **API:** POST /users/auth
- **Database:** PostgreSQL

**‚óä** Integration
- **External Services:** Email service
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens
- **Security:** Rate limiting required
```

## üìä Interactive Mode Example

```
User: need login
System: [Invisibly enhances to "create feature ticket for login"]
System: [Detects authentication = backend feature]

System: Great! Let's create a clear ticket together. I'll help you think through the key aspects:

1. What specific problem does login solve for your users?
2. What type of login do you need (email/password, social, both)?
3. How will we measure if this feature is successful?

User: Users can't save preferences. Email/password. High registration rate.

System: Perfect! Do you have any Figma designs for the login flow?

[Creates complete ticket with [BE] prefix, rich description, technical details, and labels]

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Developer Clarity Issues
- **Missing scope prefix**: Required in every title
- **Short description**: Need 1-2 full paragraphs
- **No technical details**: Add dedicated section
- **Missing labels**: Should auto-generate

### Symbol Usage Issues
- **Wrong title format**: Use `# ‚ùñ [SCOPE]`
- **Missing ‚óä**: Required for complex requirements
- **Wrong em dash**: Only use ‚Äî under **‚óä** sub-headings
- **Hierarchy confusion**: Follow ‚óá ‚Üí **‚óä** ‚Üí ‚Äî ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ pattern

### Content Issues
- **Using percentages**: Replace with descriptive terms
- **Implementation details**: Remove HOW, keep WHAT/WHY
- **Missing symbols**: Required in all sections
- **No Resolution Checklist**: Required for every ticket

### Interactive Mode
- **Too many questions**: System limits to 3-4 maximum
- **Not getting guidance**: Ensure no mode specified
- **Figma not connecting**: It's optional, continue without
