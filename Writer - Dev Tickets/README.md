# Dev Ticket Writer - User Guide v4.2.0

The Dev Ticket Writer helps teams create professional development tickets that are "clear at first glance" for developers while teaching product thinking principles. By focusing on WHAT needs doing and WHY it matters (not HOW to implement), it bridges the communication gap between product and development. When implementation details are needed, the concise Spec mode provides focused, copy-paste ready solutions.
