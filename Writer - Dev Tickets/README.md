## üìã Ticket Structure with Callouts

Every ticket section is now wrapped in appropriate callout blocks:

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> ### ‚ùñ Feature Name
> 
> **User Value:** What the user gains
> **Business Goal:** How this helps business

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## ‚óá Requirements
> - Outcome-focused bullet points
> - Clear deliverables

> [!INFO]
> ## ‚Üí Designs & References
> - [Figma designs](link)
> - [API docs](link)

> [!TIP]
> ## ‚úì Success Criteria
> - [ ] Measurable outcomes
> - [ ] Verification points

> [!TIP]
> ## ‚úì Resolution Checklist
> - [ ] Implementation steps
> - [ ] Testing tasks
> - [ ] Documentation

> [!WARNING]
> ## ‚äó Dependencies
> - Requires: Backend API (#123)
> - Blocks: Future feature (#456)
```

### Callout Mapping

| Symbol | Section Type | Callout | Visual Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| ‚ùñ | Title/Feature | `[!NOTE]` | Primary identification |
| ‚óá | Requirements | `[!IMPORTANT]` | Core requirements emphasis |
| ‚Üí | Designs/References | `[!INFO]` | Supporting information |
| ‚úì | Success/Checklist | `[!TIP]` | Actionable items |
| ‚äó | Dependencies | `[!WARNING]` | Blocking awareness |
| ‚ö† | Risks | `[!CAUTION]` | Risk mitigation |

## üìù How Prompt Improvement Works

The system invisibly enhances vague requests before processing:

### What Gets Enhanced
```
"fix auth" ‚Üí "create bug fix ticket for authentication"
"DB slow" ‚Üí "create performance ticket for database"
"need API docs" ‚Üí "create feature ticket for application programming interface documentation"
```

### Common Developer Abbreviations
- **Technical**: API, DB, UI, UX, FE, BE, auth, config, env, repo
- **Process**: QA, CI/CD, MVP, POC, PR
- **Performance**: perf, opt, mem
- **Security**: sec, vuln, 2FA

### What DOESN'T Change
- Implementation details (never added)
- Priority or complexity (never assumed)
- Mode commands ($q, $s, etc.)
- Already clear requests
- The need for Interactive mode questions

## üèóÔ∏è Core Components

### WHAT/WHY Philosophy
- **WHAT**: Clear description of the feature/fix needed
- **WHY**: User value and business outcomes
- **NOT HOW**: Leave implementation to developers

### Symbol System (Required within Callouts)
- **‚ùñ** - Titles and major features (in NOTE callouts)
- **‚óá** - Requirements and processes (in IMPORTANT callouts)
- **‚Üí** - Designs & References (in INFO callouts)
- **‚úì** - Success criteria AND Resolution Checklist (in TIP callouts)
- **‚äó** - Dependencies (in WARNING callouts)
- **‚ö†** - Risks (in CAUTION callouts)

### Ticket Structure
1. Title with ‚ùñ symbol in NOTE callout
2. User Value statement in same callout
3. Business Goal (measurable) in same callout
4. Requirements in IMPORTANT callout
5. Designs/References in INFO callout (if any)
6. Success Criteria in TIP callout
7. Resolution Checklist in TIP callout (REQUIRED)
8. Dependencies in WARNING callout (if any)
9. Risks in CAUTION callout (if any)

## üìä Interactive Mode Example

```
User: need login
System: [Invisibly enhances to "create feature ticket for login"]

System: Great! Let's create a clear ticket together. I'll help you think through the key aspects:

1. What specific problem does login solve for your users?
2. What type of login do you need (email/password, social, both)?
3. How will we measure if this feature is successful?

User: Users can't save preferences. Email/password. 80% registration rate.

System: Perfect! Do you have any Figma designs for the login flow?

## üé® Visual Enhancement Benefits

The new callout system provides:

1. **Instant Section Recognition**: Different callout types signal content purpose
2. **Improved Scannability**: Visual blocks separate concerns clearly  
3. **Consistent Rendering**: Callouts display uniformly across platforms
4. **Maintained Hierarchy**: Symbols still provide detailed categorization
5. **Enhanced Accessibility**: Better visual grouping for all readers

## ü§ñ Educational Focus

Interactive mode teaches product thinking by:
- Asking strategic questions about user value
- Focusing on business outcomes
- Showing quality metrics and scores
- Providing learning points
- Building skills through practice
- Demonstrating proper callout usage

## üìà Quality Assurance

### 2-Minute Readability
All tickets must be scannable and understood in under 2 minutes. Callouts enhance this by providing visual anchors.

### Resolution Checklist Scaling
- **Quick**: 3-5 simple tasks
- **Standard**: 8-15 tasks in categories
- **Complex**: 15-30 phase-based tasks
- **Epic**: 10-20 coordination tasks

### Success Metrics
- 85% of users complete ticket creation
- 95% meet quality standards
- <5 minute average conversation
- 100% maintain readability standards
- 100% proper callout usage

## üîß MCP Tools Integration

The system intelligently selects thinking tools based on complexity:

### Sequential Thinking MCP
- Simple requests and clear requirements
- Quick ($q) and Standard ($s) modes
- 1-3 thoughts for analysis

### Cascade Thinking MCP
- Interactive mode (always)
- Complex ($c) and Epic ($e) modes
- Unclear requirements needing exploration
- 3-5+ thoughts with branching

### Figma MCP (Optional)
- UI feature tickets
- Design extraction and understanding
- Never required, always beneficial

## üìö Example with Callouts

### Feature Request
**Input:** "need user profiles"

**Result:**
```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> ### ‚ùñ User Profile Management
> 
> **User Value:** Personalize your experience and track your activity

```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Callouts are mandatory** - Every major section needs appropriate callout
- **Never provides implementation advice** - Only creates tickets
- **Always uses artifacts** - Every ticket in markdown artifact
- **No em dashes** - Uses alternatives for readability
- **Interactive is default** - Unless mode explicitly specified
- **Figma optional** - Never blocks ticket creation
- **Quick Reference Card** - Keep open for daily use

## üì¶ Version History

- **v3.2.0**: Added callout formatting for enhanced visual hierarchy
- **v3.1.0**: Added prompt improvement layer and developer abbreviations
- **v3.0.0**: Introduced mandatory Resolution Checklists
- **v2.0.0**: Interactive mode as default, enhanced educational focus
- **v1.0.0**: Initial WHAT/WHY philosophy implementation

## üéØ Key Principles

1. **Democratize product thinking** through guided ticket creation
2. **Focus on user value** not technical implementation
3. **Teach through practice** with Interactive mode
4. **Maintain 2-minute readability** for all tickets
5. **Scale complexity appropriately** with different modes
6. **Preserve user intent** while clarifying requests
7. **Enhance visual hierarchy** with callout formatting

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Callout Formatting
- **Callout not rendering**: Check markdown processor supports GitHub-style callouts
- **Wrong callout type**: Refer to callout mapping table
- **Missing callouts**: All sections require callout wrapping

### Prompt Improvement Issues
- **Abbreviation not expanding**: Not in dictionary, will be preserved
- **Wrong enhancement**: Check bypass conditions
- **Mode not working**: Explicit mode commands bypass enhancement

### Interactive Mode
- **Too many questions**: System limits to 3-4 maximum
- **Not getting guidance**: Ensure no mode specified
- **Figma not connecting**: It's optional, continue without

### Common Problems
- **Missing symbols**: Required in all sections within callouts
- **No Resolution Checklist**: Required for every ticket
- **Too long to read**: Violates 2-minute rule
- **Implementation details**: Remove HOW, keep WHAT/WHY
