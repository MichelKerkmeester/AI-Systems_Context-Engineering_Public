## üîß Installing MCP Tools (Recommended)

The system intelligently selects between these based on task complexity. Choose either Docker (stable) or NPX (quick) installation:

### Option A: AI-Powered Docker Setup (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop installed ([Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Claude Desktop app ([Download Claude](https://claude.ai/download))

**AI-Assisted Installation:**

Copy this prompt to Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant:

```
Help me set up Docker containers for the AI Systems Spec Writer MCP tools.

I need to:
1. Create a directory at "$HOME/MCP Servers"
2. Clone these repos:
   - https://github.com/arben-adm/mcp-sequential-thinking.git
   - https://github.com/drewdotpro/cascade-thinking-mcp.git
3. Create a docker-compose.yml file with services for both
4. Configure Claude Desktop's claude_desktop_config.json
5. Start the containers with docker-compose

I'm on [Windows/Mac/Linux]. Please give me the exact commands to run.
```

The AI will provide step-by-step commands for your operating system.

**Verification:**
1. Check Docker Desktop for 2 running containers
2. Look for the üîå icon in Claude Desktop showing available tools
3. Test with: "$analyze this system"

### Option B: NPX Installation (Quick but Less Stable)

Add to Claude Desktop config file:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    },
    "cascade-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "cascade-thinking-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"I don't know where to start"**
- Just describe your goal in plain language
- Interactive mode will guide you
- Try: "I need to manage [anything]"

**"Generated README looks plain"**
- Ensure v2.0.0 template is loaded
- Check all knowledge base documents uploaded
- System should use visual separation and compelling hooks

### MCP Connection Issues
- **Docker not running**: Start Docker Desktop
- **Can't connect**: Restart Claude Desktop
- **Wrong directory**: Check you're in "$HOME/MCP Servers"
- **Permission errors**: Run terminal as administrator (Windows) or use sudo (Mac/Linux)

### Getting Help
- For Docker issues: Check container logs in Docker Desktop
- For NPX issues: Check Claude Desktop logs
- For specification issues: Use $interactive mode for guidance

.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Pattern-first approach** - Proven designs over novel experiments
- **Always uses artifacts** - Every output is reusable
- **No em dashes** - Uses commas, colons, or periods
- **Works without MCPs** - Enhanced with them but not required

## üì¶ Version History

- **v1.2.0**: Enhanced README templates with compelling documentation patterns
- **v1.1.0**: Added $readme mode and documentation generation
- **v1.0.0**: Initial release with 5 modes and pattern library

## üéØ Key Principles

1. **Democratize system architecture** - Expert design accessible to everyone
2. **Documentation drives adoption** - Great systems need great READMEs
3. **Patterns ensure quality** - Proven approaches beat experimentation
4. **Visual clarity matters** - Diagrams and formatting aid understanding
5. **Learning through creation** - Every spec teaches architectural thinking
