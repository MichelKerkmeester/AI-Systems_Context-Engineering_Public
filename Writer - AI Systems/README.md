## Overview

The AI Systems Spec Writer is a meta-system that transforms system analysis into actionable specifications. With eight operational modes, intelligent MCP integration, a comprehensive pattern library, and a streamlined 6-file architecture, it empowers both beginners and experts to architect professional AI systems through guided conversations.

This system doesn't just analyze and specify - it teaches and implements. Every interaction is an opportunity to learn architectural principles, understand patterns, and master the art of system design. Whether you're creating a simple chatbot or architecting a complex multi-system integration, the Spec Writer guides you from concept to implementation.

The v3.0 release consolidates the knowledge base for better navigation while maintaining all functionality. The invisible prompt improvement ensures even the vaguest requests become perfect specifications, and implementation checkpoints guarantee you're never left wondering "what's next?"

## üîß Installing MCP Tools (Recommended)

The system intelligently selects between Sequential and Cascade Thinking based on task complexity. Choose either Docker (stable) or NPX (quick) installation:

### Option A: AI-Powered Docker Setup (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop installed ([Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Claude Desktop app ([Download Claude](https://claude.ai/download))

**AI-Assisted Installation:**

Copy this prompt to Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant:

```
Help me set up Docker containers for the AI Systems Spec Writer MCP tools.

I need to:
1. Create a directory at "$HOME/MCP Servers"
2. Clone these repos:
   - https://github.com/sequentialthinking/sequential-thinking-mcp
   - https://github.com/cascadethinking/cascade-thinking-mcp
3. Create a docker-compose.yml file with services for both
4. Configure Claude Desktop's claude_desktop_config.json
5. Start the containers with docker-compose

I'm on [Windows/Mac/Linux]. Please give me the exact commands to run.
```

The AI will provide step-by-step commands for your operating system.

**Verification:**
1. Check Docker Desktop for 2 running containers
2. Look for the üîå icon in Claude Desktop showing available tools
3. Test with: "$analyze my current workflow"

### Option B: NPX Installation (Quick but Less Stable)

Add to Claude Desktop config file:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    },
    "cascade-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "cascade-thinking-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### System Usage Issues

**"I don't know where to start"**
- Just describe your goal in plain language (even vaguely!)
- Interactive mode activates automatically
- Prompt improvement clarifies your request invisibly
- Example: "need customer thing" works perfectly!

**"The specification seems incomplete"**
- Use `$evaluate` mode for quality assessment
- System will identify gaps and suggest improvements
- Always ends with implementation guidance

**"Too many files to navigate"**
- v3.0 consolidates to just 6 files
- Main system file now includes frameworks
- Pattern Library has all patterns and methods
- Quick Reference expanded with more examples

### MCP Connection Issues
- **Docker not running**: Start Docker Desktop
- **Can't connect**: Restart Claude Desktop
- **Wrong directory**: Check you're in "$HOME/MCP Servers"
- **Permission errors**: Run terminal as administrator (Windows) or use sudo (Mac/Linux)

### Getting Help
- For Docker issues: Check container logs in Docker Desktop
- For NPX issues: Check Claude Desktop logs
- For specification help: System always offers implementation guidance
- For pattern questions: Reference the Pattern Library & Methods
