## üîß Installing MCP Tools (Recommended)

The system intelligently selects between these based on task complexity. Choose either Docker (stable) or NPX (quick) installation:

### Option A: AI-Powered Docker Setup (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop installed ([Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Claude Desktop app ([Download Claude](https://claude.ai/download))

**AI-Assisted Installation:**

Copy this prompt to Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant:

```
Help me set up Docker containers for the AI Systems Spec Writer MCP tools.

I need to:
1. Create a directory at "$HOME/MCP Servers"
2. Clone these repos:
   - https://github.com/arben-adm/mcp-sequential-thinking.git
   - https://github.com/drewdotpro/cascade-thinking-mcp.git
3. Create a docker-compose.yml file with services for both
4. Configure Claude Desktop's claude_desktop_config.json
5. Start the containers with docker-compose

I'm on [Windows/Mac/Linux]. Please give me the exact commands to run.
```

The AI will provide step-by-step commands for your operating system.

**Verification:**
1. Check Docker Desktop for 2 running containers
2. Look for the üîå icon in Claude Desktop showing available tools
3. Test with: "$analyze this chat system"

### Option B: NPX Installation (Quick but Less Stable)

Add to Claude Desktop config file:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    },
    "cascade-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "cascade-thinking-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### MCP Connection Issues
- **Docker not running**: Start Docker Desktop
- **Can't connect**: Restart Claude Desktop
- **Wrong directory**: Check you're in "$HOME/MCP Servers"
- **Permission errors**: Run terminal as administrator (Windows) or use sudo (Mac/Linux)

### Common Setup Problems
- **"Command not found"**: Ensure Node.js is installed for NPX method
- **Containers won't start**: Check Docker Desktop is running
- **Tools not showing**: Restart Claude Desktop after config changes
- **Rate limits**: Both tools handle this gracefully with retries

### Getting Help
- For Docker issues: Check container logs in Docker Desktop
- For NPX issues: Check Claude Desktop logs
- For general issues: The AI assistant can help diagnose problems

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Interactive mode is DEFAULT** - Unless explicitly specified otherwise
- **Pattern-first approach** - Apply proven designs consistently
- **Always use artifacts** - Ensures reusability and sharing
- **No em dashes** - Uses commas, colons, or periods
- **Works without MCPs** - But enhanced with them

## üì¶ Version History

- **v1.1.0**: Added README generation mode and documentation patterns
- **v1.0.0**: Initial release with 5 modes and pattern library
- **v0.9.0**: Beta with core analysis capabilities

## üéØ Key Principles

1. **Democratize system architecture** - Anyone can design AI systems
2. **Learn by doing** - Educational at every step
3. **Patterns over perfection** - Proven designs beat novel approaches
4. **Visual understanding** - Architecture diagrams clarify complexity
5. **Documentation matters** - Systems without docs don't get adopted
