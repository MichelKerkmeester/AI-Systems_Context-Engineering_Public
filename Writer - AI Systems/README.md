## üõ†Ô∏è MCP Installation Guide (Docker Desktop)

MCPs (Model Context Protocol) enhance the system's analytical capabilities. This guide uses Docker Desktop for easy management and reliable operation.

### Prerequisites
- **Docker Desktop** installed and running ([Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- **Claude Desktop** app installed ([Download Claude](https://claude.ai/download))
- **Git** installed (for cloning repositories)
- At least 2GB of free disk space

### Quick Installation Steps

#### 1. Create MCP Servers Directory
```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/MCP Servers"
cd "$HOME/MCP Servers"
```

#### 2. Clone the MCP Repositories
```bash
# Clone Sequential Thinking MCP
git clone https://github.com/arben-adm/mcp-sequential-thinking.git

# Clone Cascade Thinking MCP  
git clone https://github.com/drewdotpro/cascade-thinking-mcp.git
```

#### 3. Download Docker Configuration Files
Create these files in your MCP Servers directory:

**docker-compose.yml**:
```yaml
services:
  # Sequential Thinking MCP Server
  sequential-thinking:
    build:
      context: ./mcp-sequential-thinking
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: mcp-sequential-thinking:latest
    container_name: mcp-sequential-thinking
    restart: always
    environment:
      - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
    volumes:
      - sequential-data:/app/data
      - ./mcp-sequential-thinking/logs:/app/logs
    networks:
      - mcp-network
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "echo", "healthy"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3

  # Cascade Thinking MCP Server
  cascade-thinking:
    build:
      context: ./cascade-thinking-mcp
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: mcp-cascade-thinking:latest
    container_name: mcp-cascade-thinking
    restart: always
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    volumes:
      - cascade-data:/app/data
      - ./cascade-thinking-mcp/logs:/app/logs
    networks:
      - mcp-network
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "echo", "healthy"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3

volumes:
  sequential-data:
    name: mcp-sequential-data
  cascade-data:
    name: mcp-cascade-data

networks:
  mcp-network:
    name: mcp-network
    driver: bridge
```

#### 4. Create Management Scripts

**start-mcp-servers.sh**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "üöÄ Starting MCP servers in Docker..."
cd "$(dirname "$0")"

echo "üì¶ Building Docker images..."
docker-compose build

echo "üèÉ Starting containers..."
docker-compose up -d

sleep 3
echo "‚úÖ Container status:"
docker-compose ps

echo ""
echo "‚ú® MCP servers are now running in Docker!"
echo "üê≥ You can see them in Docker Desktop app"
```

**stop-mcp-servers.sh**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "üõë Stopping MCP servers..."
cd "$(dirname "$0")"
docker-compose down
echo "‚úÖ MCP servers stopped!"
```

Make scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x start-mcp-servers.sh
chmod +x stop-mcp-servers.sh
```

#### 5. Configure Claude Desktop

Find your Claude configuration file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Add this configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cascade-thinking": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["exec", "-i", "mcp-cascade-thinking", "node", "dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["exec", "-i", "mcp-sequential-thinking", "uv", "run", "--with", "portalocker", "-m", "mcp_sequential_thinking.server"],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 6. Start the MCP Servers
```bash
cd "$HOME/MCP Servers"
./start-mcp-servers.sh
```

#### 7. Restart Claude Desktop
Quit and restart Claude Desktop to load the new MCP server configuration.

### üê≥ Docker Desktop Management

#### View Container Status
Open Docker Desktop to see:
- Running containers: `mcp-sequential-thinking` and `mcp-cascade-thinking`
- Resource usage (CPU/Memory)
- Container logs (click on container ‚Üí "Logs" tab)

#### Quick Commands
```bash
# Check status
docker ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Restart a specific server
docker-compose restart sequential-thinking

# Update servers
git -C mcp-sequential-thinking pull
git -C cascade-thinking-mcp pull
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

### üîß Troubleshooting

**Containers won't start:**
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- Check logs: `docker-compose logs`
- Rebuild: `docker-compose build --no-cache`

**Claude can't connect:**
- Verify containers are running in Docker Desktop
- Restart Claude Desktop
- Check configuration file syntax

**Permission errors:**
- Make scripts executable: `chmod +x *.sh`
- On Linux/macOS, may need: `sudo docker-compose up -d`

### üìä Verification
1. **Docker Desktop**: Two green containers running
2. **Claude Desktop**: Look for üîå icon showing MCP connections
3. **Test**: Try using sequential or cascade thinking in Claude
