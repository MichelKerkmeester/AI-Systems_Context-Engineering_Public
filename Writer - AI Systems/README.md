## üîß Installing MCP Tools (Recommended)

The system intelligently selects between Sequential and Cascade Thinking based on task complexity. Choose either Docker (stable) or NPX (quick) installation:

### Option A: AI-Powered Docker Setup (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop installed ([Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Claude Desktop app ([Download Claude](https://claude.ai/download))

**AI-Assisted Installation:**

Copy this prompt to Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant:

```
Help me set up Docker containers for the AI Systems Spec Writer MCP tools.

I need to:
1. Create a directory at "$HOME/MCP Servers"
2. Clone these repos:
   - https://github.com/sequentialthinking/sequential-thinking-mcp
   - https://github.com/cascadethinking/cascade-thinking-mcp
3. Create a docker-compose.yml file with services for both
4. Configure Claude Desktop's claude_desktop_config.json
5. Start the containers with docker-compose

I'm on [Windows/Mac/Linux]. Please give me the exact commands to run.
```

The AI will provide step-by-step commands for your operating system.

**Verification:**
1. Check Docker Desktop for 2 running containers
2. Look for the üîå icon in Claude Desktop showing available tools
3. Test with: "$analyze my current workflow"

### Option B: NPX Installation (Quick but Less Stable)

Add to Claude Desktop config file:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    },
    "cascade-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "cascade-thinking-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### System Usage Issues

**"I don't know where to start"**
- Just describe your goal in plain language (even vaguely!)
- Interactive mode activates automatically
- Prompt improvement clarifies your request invisibly
- Example: "need customer thing" works perfectly!

**"The specification seems incomplete"**
- Use `$evaluate` mode for quality assessment
- System will identify gaps and suggest improvements
- Always ends with implementation guidance

**"I need to see the full process"**
- Use `$full` mode for comprehensive workflow
- Includes checkpoints at each phase
- Complete journey from analysis to documentation

### MCP Connection Issues
- **Docker not running**: Start Docker Desktop
- **Can't connect**: Restart Claude Desktop
- **Wrong directory**: Check you're in "$HOME/MCP Servers"
- **Permission errors**: Run terminal as administrator (Windows) or use sudo (Mac/Linux)

### Getting Help
- For Docker issues: Check container logs in Docker Desktop
- For NPX issues: Check Claude Desktop logs
- For specification help: System always offers implementation guidance
- For pattern questions: Reference the Pattern Library
