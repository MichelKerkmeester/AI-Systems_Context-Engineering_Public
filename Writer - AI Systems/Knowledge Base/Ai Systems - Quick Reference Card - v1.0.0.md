## 1. 🚀 MODE ACTIVATION

| Mode | Command | When to Use | MCP |
|------|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Interactive** | DEFAULT | Guided creation | Cascade 5-7 |
| **Analyze** | `$analyze` | System review | Sequential 5-6 |
| **Create** | `$create` | New system | Cascade 7-10 |
| **Update** | `$update` | Enhancements | Sequential 3-4 |
| **Integrate** | `$integrate` | Combine systems | Cascade 10+ |
| **Readme** | `$readme` | Documentation | Adaptive 3-5+ |

## 5. 💡 QUICK FIXES

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Vague Requirements?**
→ Switch to `$interactive` mode for guided discovery

**Missing Architecture?**
→ Apply Mode System Pattern + visual diagram

**No Quality Metrics?**
→ Add multi-dimensional Framework Pattern

**Too Complex?**
→ Use `$full` mode for phased workflow

**Unclear Patterns?**
→ Reference Pattern Library for examples

**Implementation Questions?**
→ Always offer development guidance (Rule 16)

**Missing Implementation Offer?**
→ Add Implementation Checkpoint Pattern immediately

## 6. 🚨 MCP SELECTION GUIDE

```
Decision Tree:
├─ Simple/Clear request
│  └─ Sequential (1-4 thoughts)
├─ Standard complexity
│  └─ Sequential (5-6 thoughts)
├─ Interactive mode
│  └─ Cascade (5-7 thoughts) ALWAYS
├─ Complex/Multi-path
│  └─ Cascade (7-10 thoughts)
└─ Full workflow
   └─ Cascade (15+ thoughts)
```

**Quick Rules:**
- Interactive = Always Cascade
- Analysis = Usually Sequential
- Creation = Usually Cascade
- Simple edits = Sequential
- Integration = Always Cascade

2. Answer 3-5 questions
3. Receive complete specification
4. Get implementation offer (always!)

### For Specific Needs
```
Analyze: $analyze [system/description]
Create:  $create [new system idea]
Update:  $update [enhancement needs]
Full:    $full [comprehensive workflow]
```

### Best Practices
1. Start with interactive if unsure
