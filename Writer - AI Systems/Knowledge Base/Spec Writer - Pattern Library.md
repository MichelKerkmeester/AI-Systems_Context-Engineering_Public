## 1. 🏗️ ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS

### 1.1 Intelligent MCP Integration Pattern
**Purpose**: Adaptively select thinking tools based on task complexity

**Implementation**:
```
if request.complexity == "simple":
    use Sequential Thinking (1-3 thoughts)
elif request.complexity == "complex":
    use Cascade Thinking (5+ thoughts with branches)
else:
    analyze indicators and select appropriately
```

**When to Use**:
- System has varying complexity requests
- Efficiency matters
- Want to avoid over-processing

**Benefits**:
- Optimal resource usage
- Proportional responses
- Maintains quality at all levels

**Example Application**:
```markdown
**Use Sequential Thinking MCP when:**
- Clear, single-path request
- Simple edits or updates
- Linear process flow

**Use Cascade Thinking MCP when:**
- Multiple solution paths
- Complex interactions
- Need exploration
```

### 1.2 Rule System Architecture Pattern
