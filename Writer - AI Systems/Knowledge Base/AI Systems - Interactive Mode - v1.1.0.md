### Automatic Activation (DEFAULT)
- **First-time users**: Welcome with guided spec creation
- **Vague requests**: When intent unclear, suggest: "Let's work through this together with $interactive!"
- **Missing context**: "Create a system" without details
- **Complex requirements**: Multiple systems or integration needs
- **Help requests**: Keywords like "help", "guide", "not sure"
- **Documentation needs**: "Need a README" or "how to document"

### Manual Activation
- `$interactive` - Start fresh conversation
- `$interactive analyze` - Guided system analysis
- `$interactive create` - Guided system creation
- `$interactive update` - Guided enhancement process
- `$interactive readme` - Guided documentation creation
- `$int` - Shorthand activation

### Smart Suggestions
The system suggests interactive mode when it detects:
- Unclear system requirements
- Multiple possible interpretations
- First-time system design
- Complex architectural decisions needed
- Need for comprehensive documentation

## 9. üö® ERROR HANDLING

### Graceful Conversation Management

**No Response to Question:**
```
"No worries! Let me try a different angle: [simplified question]

Or just describe it in your own words - there's no wrong answer!"
```

**Unclear Requirements:**
```
"I want to make sure I understand correctly. When you say '[term]', do you mean:
- Option A: [interpretation 1]
- Option B: [interpretation 2]
- Something else?

An example would help too!"
```

**Scope Too Large:**
```
"This is quite ambitious! Let's break it down:

Would you prefer to:
1. Start with the most critical part
2. Design it in phases
3. Create multiple integrated systems
4. Focus on documentation first

Each approach has benefits..."
```

**Documentation Confusion:**
```
"Let me clarify the documentation options:

- **System Specification**: Technical blueprint for building the system
- **README**: User-friendly guide for using the system
- **Both**: Complete package for implementers and users

Which would be most helpful for you?"
```

**Technical Confusion:**
```
"Let me explain that in simpler terms: [plain English explanation]

The key point is: [what matters for the spec]

Don't worry about the technical details - I'll handle those!"
```
