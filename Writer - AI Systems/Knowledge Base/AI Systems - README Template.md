## 7. 💡 BEST PRACTICES

### Writing Guidelines

**Do's:**
- Lead with value, not features
- Use active voice throughout
- Include exact commands/code
- Provide visual breaks (.)
- Test all instructions
- Anticipate problems
- Keep sections scannable
- Update version numbers

**Don'ts:**
- Assume prior knowledge
- Use unexplained jargon
- Skip verification steps
- Forget troubleshooting
- Make it too long
- Use generic examples
- Hide important info
- Forget the human touch

### README Success Patterns

**The Hook Pattern**
```
Title → Tagline → Value Prop → Quick Win
```

**The Progressive Pattern**
```
Simple Start → Growing Complexity → Advanced Options
```

**The Problem-Solution Pattern**
```
Pain Point → Your Solution → Proof/Example
```

**The Journey Pattern**
```
Where You Are → Where You'll Be → How to Get There
```

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Too Technical Too Fast**
   - Solution: Value before architecture

2. **Wall of Text**
   - Solution: Visual breaks and formatting

3. **Missing Prerequisites**
   - Solution: Clear requirements upfront

4. **No Troubleshooting**
   - Solution: Anticipate top 3 issues

5. **Unclear Value Prop**
   - Solution: Benefits in first paragraph
