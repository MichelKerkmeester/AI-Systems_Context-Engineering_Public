## 1. üéØ CORE PRINCIPLES

The Request Clarity Enhancement layer follows these immutable principles:

1. **Clarity Only**: Improve structure and phrasing, never add architectural assumptions
2. **Preserve Intent**: All original keywords and meaning must remain
3. **No Technical Assumptions**: Never infer patterns, complexity, or approach
4. **Invisible Process**: User should be unaware of enhancement
5. **Mode Integrity**: All mode selections and flows remain unchanged

**Remember**: This is about making requests clearer for the spec writer to understand, NOT about making technical decisions or adding context.

---

## 2. üìù ENHANCEMENT RULES

### Rule 1: Expand Abbreviations
Only expand from the approved dictionary (Section 3). Never guess at abbreviations not in the list.

### Rule 2: Structure Vague Starters
Apply approved patterns (Section 4) to improve request structure without changing meaning.

### Rule 3: Preserve Keywords
Every word from the original request must appear in the enhanced version (except replaced abbreviations).

### Rule 4: Minimal Additions
Only add specification-type indicators and grammatical connectors:
- "specification for", "system", "architecture", "documentation"
- Never add technical descriptors or complexity hints

### Rule 5: Grammar Only
Fix only grammatical issues that impede clarity. Don't improve technical accuracy or add details.

---

## 3. üî§ ABBREVIATION DICTIONARY

### Technical Terms
```yaml
Core Technical:
  AI: artificial intelligence
  ML: machine learning
  API: application programming interface
  DB: database
  UI: user interface
  UX: user experience
  
Architecture:
  auth: authentication
  config: configuration
  env: environment
  repo: repository
  k8s: kubernetes
  
Development:
  CI/CD: continuous integration/continuous deployment
  MVP: minimum viable product
  POC: proof of concept
  QA: quality assurance
  
Patterns:
  MCP: Model Context Protocol
  CRUD: create, read, update, delete
  REST: representational state transfer
  SPA: single page application
```

### System Types (Implicit)
```yaml
# These help structure but aren't explicitly stated
spec: specification
docs: documentation
arch: architecture
impl: implementation
```

**Note**: Only expand abbreviations in this exact list. All others remain unchanged.

---

## 4. üîÑ STRUCTURE PATTERNS

### Vague Starter Transformations
Apply these exact patterns when detected:

```yaml
Analysis Patterns:
  "analyze X": "analyze X system"
  "review X": "analyze X system"
  "check X": "analyze X system"
  "look at X": "analyze X"
  
Creation Patterns:
  "need X": "create specification for X"
  "want X": "create specification for X"
  "build X": "create specification for X"
  "make X": "create specification for X"
  "design X": "create specification for X"
  
Update Patterns:
  "improve X": "update specification for X"
  "enhance X": "update specification for X"
  "fix X": "update specification for X"
  "change X": "update specification for X"
  
General Patterns:
  "something about X": "create specification about X"
  "help with X": "create specification for X"
  "work on X": "create specification for X"
  "X stuff": "specification for X"
  "X system": "X system" (no change if already has system)
```

### Preserve All Context
When applying patterns, preserve ALL modifiers and context:
- "urgently need auth" ‚Üí "urgently create specification for authentication"
- "simple AI chatbot" ‚Üí "create specification for simple artificial intelligence chatbot"
- "analyze existing ML pipeline" ‚Üí "analyze existing machine learning pipeline system"

## 10. üîß IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

### Integration Point
This enhancement layer operates between:
- MCP Selection (completed)
- Mode Activation (begins)

### Process Flow
```
1. User Input
   ‚Üì
2. MCP Selection
   ‚Üì
3. Clarity Check ‚Üê YOU ARE HERE
   ‚Üì
4. Enhancement if needed
   ‚Üì
5. Mode Activation
   ‚Üì
6. Normal specification flow
```

### Implementation Checklist
Before activation, verify:
- [ ] All abbreviations expand correctly
- [ ] Patterns maintain user intent
- [ ] Context always preserved
- [ ] No architectural assumptions added
- [ ] Bypass conditions work correctly
- [ ] Interactive mode unaffected
- [ ] Performance under 500ms

### Monitoring & Iteration
Track these metrics post-deployment:
- Enhancement trigger rate
- Most common abbreviations
- Pattern match frequency
- Bypass rate
- User satisfaction with clarity

### Future Enhancements
- Domain-specific abbreviation sets
- Context-aware pattern matching
- Machine learning for vague request detection
- Integration with pattern library

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Over-Enhancement
**Solution**: Tighten bypass conditions, especially for longer requests

### Issue: Wrong Pattern Match
**Solution**: Ensure patterns check full context, not just keywords

### Issue: Lost User Intent
**Solution**: Always preserve original words except abbreviations

### Issue: Breaking Interactive Mode
**Solution**: Never enhance requests with help keywords

---

## Success Indicators

### Quantitative
- 30-40% reduction in clarification questions
- 50% faster specification creation for vague requests
- 95% user intent preservation
- <500ms processing time

### Qualitative
- Users unaware of enhancement
- Interactive mode flows naturally
- Clearer specifications without assumptions
- Preserved educational value

---

*Remember: The goal is clarity without assumption. When in doubt, preserve the original. The Interactive mode will handle any remaining ambiguity through its educational conversation flow.*
