## 🔧 Installing MCP Tools (Recommended)

The system intelligently selects between these based on [complexity indicator]. Choose either Docker (stable) or NPX (quick) installation:

### Option A: AI-Powered Docker Setup (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop installed ([Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Claude Desktop app ([Download Claude](https://claude.ai/download))
- [Any API keys needed]

**AI-Assisted Installation:**

Copy this prompt to Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant:

```
Help me set up Docker containers for the [System Name] MCP tools.

I need to:
1. Create a directory at "$HOME/MCP Servers"
2. Clone these repos:
   - [Repository URLs]
3. Create a docker-compose.yml file with services for [all tools]
4. Configure Claude Desktop's claude_desktop_config.json
5. Start the containers with docker-compose

I'm on [Windows/Mac/Linux]. Please give me the exact commands to run.
```

The AI will provide step-by-step commands for your operating system.

**Verification:**
1. Check Docker Desktop for [X] running containers
2. Look for the 🔌 icon in Claude Desktop showing available tools
3. Test with: "[Simple test command]"

### Option B: NPX Installation (Quick but Less Stable)

Add to Claude Desktop config file:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "[tool-name]": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "[package-name]"]
    }
  }
}
```
