## Overview

The AI Systems Spec Writer is a meta-system that transforms system analysis into actionable specifications. With eight operational modes, intelligent native thinking, a comprehensive pattern library, and a streamlined 6-file architecture, it empowers both beginners and experts to architect professional AI systems through guided conversations.

This system doesn't just analyze and specify - it teaches and implements. Every interaction is an opportunity to learn architectural principles, understand patterns, and master the art of system design. Whether you're creating a simple chatbot or architecting a complex multi-system integration, the Spec Writer guides you from concept to implementation.

The v3.1 release introduces native Claude thinking with user-controlled depth. You decide how thoroughly the AI should think through your request, from quick 1-3 round analyses to deep 15+ round explorations. The invisible prompt improvement ensures even the vaguest requests become perfect specifications, and implementation checkpoints guarantee you're never left wondering "what's next?"

## üöÄ Quick Setup in Claude

### Step 1: Create a New Project
1. Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. Click "Projects" in sidebar
3. Click "Create project"
4. Name it "AI Systems Spec Writer v3.1"

### Step 2: Add System Instructions
1. In your project, click "Edit project details"
2. Find "Custom instructions" section
3. Copy and paste: `Writer - AI Systems.md`
4. Save the project

### Step 3: Upload Knowledge Base (6 Files)
Add these essential documents to your project:
1. `Writer - AI Systems.md` (Main system - enhanced with native thinking)
2. `AI Systems - Interactive Mode.md` (Standalone with thinking rounds)
3. `AI Systems - Prompt Improvement.md` (Standalone)
4. `AI Systems - Pattern Library & Methods.md` (Consolidated with native thinking)
5. `AI Systems - Quick Reference Card.md` (Expanded with thinking guidance)
6. `README.md` (This file)

### Step 4: Start Creating!
Simply describe what you need - the AI will ask how deeply to think about it:
```
need AI system
I want to organize my customer data
Help me build a content review system
Create something to manage team tasks
```

The AI will respond: "How many thinking rounds should I use? (Quick: 1-3, Standard: 4-7, Deep: 8-15, Comprehensive: 15+)"

.

## üéØ How to Use

### Basic Usage (Interactive Mode - DEFAULT)
Simply describe what you need (even vaguely!):
```
I want to build a content moderation system
need ML pipeline
analyze auth API
```

The system will:
1. Invisibly enhance your request for clarity
2. **Ask how many thinking rounds to use** (NEW!)
3. Welcome you with friendly guidance
4. Ask 3-5 strategic questions
5. Build your specification progressively
6. Generate complete documentation
7. **Offer implementation help** (always!)
