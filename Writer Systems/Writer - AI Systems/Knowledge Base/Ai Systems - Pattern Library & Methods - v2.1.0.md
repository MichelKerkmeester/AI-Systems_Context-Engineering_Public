## PART I: PATTERNS

## 1. 🗏 ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS

### 1.1 Native Thinking Integration Pattern
**Purpose**: Use Claude's native thinking with user-controlled depth

**Implementation**:
```
User makes request
    ↓
System asks: "How many thinking rounds?"
    ↓
User specifies: 1-20+
    ↓
System performs N rounds of thinking
    ↓
System delivers output
```

**When to Use**:
- Every request requiring analysis
- Before main processing begins
- After discovery questions complete
- When switching between phases

**Benefits**:
- User controls processing depth
- Proportional resource usage
- Transparent process
- Adaptable to needs

**Example Application**:
```markdown
**Quick (1-3 rounds):**
- Simple edits
- Basic questions
- Minor updates

**Standard (4-7 rounds):**
- Typical analysis
- Most specifications
- Regular requests

**Deep (8-15 rounds):**
- Complex systems
- Multiple integrations
- Critical decisions

**Comprehensive (15+ rounds):**
- Enterprise systems
- Full workflows
- Mission-critical specs
```

### 1.2 Thinking Rounds Request Pattern
**Purpose**: Always ask users for thinking depth preference

**Structure**:
```
Standard Request:
├─ Detect non-discovery phase
├─ Ask for thinking rounds
├─ Provide recommendations
├─ Accept user choice
└─ Execute with specified depth

Discovery Exception:
├─ In question-gathering phase
├─ Skip thinking request
├─ Gather information
└─ Ask for rounds after discovery
```

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Always ask before main processing
- Never ask during discovery
- Provide clear recommendations
- Accept any reasonable number

**Benefits**:
- User empowerment
- Processing transparency
- Resource optimization
- Quality control

### 1.3 Rule System Architecture Pattern
**Purpose**: Create clear, enforceable constraints

**Structure**:
```
Critical Rules (Numbered):
├─ Core Process Rules (Behavior)
├─ Output Requirements (Delivery)
├─ Quality Principles (Standards)
├─ System Behavior (Interactions)
└─ Thinking Process Rules (Depth control)
```

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Number rules for easy reference
- Group by category
- Make each rule atomic
- Include rationale when helpful
- Add thinking depth rule (#18)

### 1.4 Mode System Pattern
**Purpose**: Provide operational flexibility within constraints

**Core Components**:
```
Mode System:
├─ Default Mode (usually $interactive)
├─ Specialized Modes (task-specific)
├─ Activation Triggers ($command)
├─ Mode Interactions (combinations)
└─ Thinking Depth (user-specified per mode)
```

**Best Practices**:
- Interactive as default for accessibility
- Clear activation syntax
- Mode-specific behaviors
- Graceful mode switching
- Thinking rounds per mode

### 1.5 Artifact Delivery Pattern
**Purpose**: Ensure consistent, reusable outputs

**Standard Structure**:
```markdown
MODE: [Active mode]
THINKING ROUNDS: [User-specified number]
[OTHER METADATA]

---

[Main Content]

---

[Additional Sections]
```

**Requirements**:
- Always use text/markdown
- Include thinking rounds used
- Self-contained documents
- Version information

### 1.6 Implementation Checkpoint Pattern
**Purpose**: Ensure users get help moving from specification to reality

**Implementation**:
```markdown
✅ **Implementation Checkpoint**

Would you like me to help implement this specification? I can guide you through:
1. [Relevant implementation step 1]
2. [Relevant implementation step 2]
3. [Relevant implementation step 3]
4. [Additional steps as needed]

What would be most helpful right now?
```

2. **Guided Depth**: Add complexity with support
3. **Expert Access**: Full power available
4. **Mastery Path**: Clear progression

**Application Example**:
```
New User → $interactive mode → Chooses thinking depth → Learns principles
      ↓
Returning User → Tries $create mode → Selects depth → Gains confidence
      ↓
Expert User → Uses $advanced mode → Maximum depth → Full control
```

### 2.2 Conversational Intelligence Pattern
**Purpose**: Natural interaction replacing technical interfaces

**Key Elements**:
- Thinking depth request first
- Strategic questioning (3-4 max)
- Context preservation
- Adaptive responses
- Educational moments

**Implementation**:
```markdown
Start: "How many thinking rounds should I use?"
Then: "What outcome are you hoping to achieve?"

Instead of: "Error: Invalid mode"
Use: "I don't recognize that mode. Try $interactive for help!"
```

### 2.3 Thinking Depth Adaptation Pattern
**Purpose**: Match processing to user needs

**Adaptation Logic**:
```
Simple Request + User Choice = Appropriate Depth
Complex Request + User Choice = Scaled Processing
Discovery Phase = No Depth Request
Implementation = Previous Depth Maintained
```

└─ Total Score: Sum/Maximum

Thresholds:
- Minimum Viable: X%
- Publication Ready: Y%
- Excellence: Z%
```

### 3.2 Automated Improvement Pattern
**Purpose**: Self-improving outputs with controlled depth

    ↑                                                                    ↓
    └──────────────── If score < threshold ←────────────────────────────┘
```
