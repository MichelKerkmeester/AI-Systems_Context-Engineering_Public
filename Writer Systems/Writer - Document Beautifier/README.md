## 🎯 Automatic Structure Detection

### Native Thinking Analysis

The system intelligently detects structure patterns:

| Document Signals | Thinking Type | Suggested Rounds | Applied Framework |
|-----------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Clear linear flow | **Linear** | 1-2 | Standard template |
| Mixed content | **Exploratory** | 3-4 | Multiple options |
| Technical terms | **Linear** | 2-3 | Technical format |
| Academic citations | **Linear** | 2-3 | Academic structure |
| Business metrics | **Linear** | 2-3 | Business template |
| Unclear structure | **Exploratory** | 4-5 | Interactive exploration |

### Example Flow
```
User: [pastes wall of text about project management]

System: I'll analyze this document about project management.

How many rounds of thinking should I use?
- 1-2 rounds: Basic structure analysis
- 3-4 rounds: Explore multiple organization patterns
- 5 rounds: Comprehensive restructuring options
(Your document has mixed content, I recommend 4 rounds)

User: Let's do 4 rounds

System: [Thinking: 4 rounds analyzing patterns]
[Detects: Mixed business/technical content]

I can format this as:
1. Business Report (executive-focused)
2. Technical Documentation (detail-focused)
3. Hybrid Structure (both audiences)

Which would work best?

**When to use:**
- Clear document structure visible
- Technical documentation
- Academic papers
- Business reports with standard format
- Simple formatting needs
- Step-by-step guides

**Round Scaling:**
- 1 round: Very clear structure, minimal complexity
- 2 rounds: Standard documents, normal formatting
- 3 rounds: Complex but linear organization

### Exploratory Thinking (3-5 rounds)
**When to use:**
- Mixed content types
- Unclear organization
- Multiple valid structures

.

## 📊 Formatting Patterns

### Universal Standards
- **Headers**: Clear hierarchy with consistent numbering
- **Lists**: Parallel construction, proper nesting
- **Emphasis**: Bold → key terms, Italic → definitions
- **Tables**: Aligned columns with clear headers
- **Code**: Syntax highlighting with language tags
- **Quotes**: Blockquotes for important notes

### Framework Applications

**SCAN Framework**
```
S - Summary (10% of document)
C - Core Content (70% of document)
A - Additional Details (15% of document)
N - Navigation/Next Steps (5% of document)
```

**HIERARCHY Framework**
```
H - Headers → Main topics
I - Information → Details
E - Examples → Illustrations
R - References → Citations
A - Actions → Tasks
R - Review → Summaries
C - Connections → Links
H - Highlights → Key points
Y - Yield → Outcomes
```

**PREP Framework**
```
P - Purpose/Problem
R - Research/Results
E - Evidence/Examples
P - Plan/Proposal
```

.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Mode Issues
- **Interactive not working?** - That's the default, no command needed
- **Wrong format applied?** - Specify mode explicitly ($technical, etc.)
- **Structure unclear?** - System will ask for more thinking rounds

### Thinking Integration
- **Not asked about rounds?** - System always asks before final output
- **Wrong analysis depth?** - Specify different number of rounds
- **Need more exploration?** - Request 4-5 rounds

### Common Issues
- **Lost content?** - Never happens, all content preserved
- **Too many sections?** - Try Quick format in Interactive
- **Not enough structure?** - Try Deep restructure option
