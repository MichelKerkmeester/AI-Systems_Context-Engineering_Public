2. Click "Projects" in sidebar
3. Click "Create project"
4. Name it "Document Beautifier v2.0.0"

### Step 2: Add System Instructions
1. In your project, click "Edit project details"
2. Find "Custom instructions" section
3. Copy and paste: `Document Beautifier - Main System - v2.0.0.md`
4. Save the project

### Step 3: Upload Supporting Documents
Add these to your project's knowledge base:
- `Document Beautifier - ATLAS Thinking Framework - v2.0.0.md`

|-----------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Clear linear flow | **Linear** | 1-2 | Standard template |
| Mixed content | **Exploratory** | 3-4 | Multiple options |
| Technical terms | **Linear** | 2-3 | Technical format |
| Academic citations | **Linear** | 2-3 | Academic structure |
| Business metrics | **Linear** | 2-3 | Business template |
| Unclear structure | **Exploratory** | 4-5 | Interactive exploration |

### Example Flow

## 🤔 Native Thinking Integration

### Thinking Depth Control

**User Always Chooses:**
- System ALWAYS asks for thinking rounds (1-5)
- Then asks for content mode (Strict/Enhanced)
- Provides recommendations for both
- Exception: During discovery questions (before final output)

### Linear Thinking (1-3 rounds)
**When to use:**
- Clear document structure visible
- Technical documentation
- Academic papers
- Business reports with standard format
- Simple formatting needs

### Exploratory Thinking (3-5 rounds)
**When to use:**
- Mixed content types
- Unclear organization
- Multiple valid structures
- Interactive mode (exploring options)
- Complex restructuring needed

.

## 🧠 ATLAS Thinking Framework

### Overview
The Document Beautifier now uses the ATLAS framework for all document analysis, providing structured thinking with built-in complexity challenges.

### The Five Phases

#### A - Assess & Challenge
- Understand document needs
- **Challenge complexity assumptions**
- Propose simpler alternatives
- "Could minimal formatting work?"

#### T - Transform Patterns
- Identify optimal structures
- Choose minimal viable format
- **Challenge:** "Would the minimal version work?"

#### L - Layer Formatting
- Apply formatting with restraint
- Each addition must be necessary
- **Challenge every enhancement**

#### A - Assess Readability
- Validate improvements
- Simplification pass
- **Remove unnecessary formatting**

#### S - Synthesize & Deliver
- Generate artifact
- Include integrity report
- **Note simpler alternatives**

### Challenge Integration
The system now actively challenges at key decision points:
- 3+ rounds requested → "Could 2 rounds work with a simpler approach?"
- Enhanced mode chosen → "Would Strict preserve your voice better?"
- Deep restructure → "Would Standard formatting suffice?"
- Complex hierarchy → "Would a flatter structure be clearer?"

### Pattern Learning
The system tracks your preferences and adapts:
- After 3 similar documents → Suggests your patterns
- After 5 consistent choices → Updates defaults
- Challenge acceptance rate → Adjusts recommendations

.

## 📊 Formatting Patterns

### Universal Standards
- **Headers**: Clear hierarchy with consistent numbering
- **Lists**: Parallel construction, proper nesting
- **Emphasis**: Bold → key terms, Italic → definitions
- **Tables**: Aligned columns with clear headers
- **Code**: Syntax highlighting with language tags
- **Quotes**: Blockquotes for important notes
- **[AI-ADDED]**: Marks enhanced content (Enhanced mode only)

### Framework Applications

**SCAN Framework**
```
S - Summary (10% of document)
C - Core Content (70% of document)
A - Additional Details (15% of document)
N - Navigation/Next Steps (5% of document)
```

**HIERARCHY Framework**
```
H - Headers → Main topics
I - Information → Details
E - Examples → Illustrations
R - References → Citations
A - Actions → Tasks
R - Review → Summaries
C - Connections → Links
H - Highlights → Key points
Y - Yield → Outcomes
```

**PREP Framework**
```
P - Purpose/Problem
R - Research/Results
E - Evidence/Examples
P - Plan/Proposal
```

.

## 🔧 Special Commands

### Content Control Commands
- `$strict` - Switch to preservation only mode
- `$enhanced` - Switch to enhanced mode with additions
- `$check` - Verify content integrity and list all changes

### NEW Simplification Commands (v2.0.0)
- `$minimal` - Apply absolute minimum formatting
- `$lean` - Strip to essential structure only
- `$simplify` - Reduce current complexity

### Example Usage

#### $strict
```
User: Actually, $strict - just reorganize, don't add anything

System: Switching to Strict mode. I'll preserve your content exactly.
[Removes any additions, keeps only original content]
```

#### $enhanced
```
User: $enhanced - please add helpful examples

System: Switching to Enhanced mode. I'll add clarifications and examples.
[Adds improvements marked with [AI-ADDED]]
```

#### $check
```
User: $check

System: 🔍 Content Integrity Check
Original words: 1,234
Current words: 1,456
Additions detected: 12

Options:
1. Remove all additions (strict version)
2. Keep current version
3. Mark additions more prominently
4. Generate comparison view

What would you prefer?
```

#### $minimal (NEW)
```
User: $minimal

System: Applying minimal formatting - just essential structure.
[Strips to headers and basic emphasis only]
```

.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Content Issues
- **Unwanted additions?** - Use $strict or $check command
- **Need more clarity?** - Switch to $enhanced mode
- **Too many [AI-ADDED] tags?** - Use $strict for cleaner output
- **Lost content?** - Never happens, all content preserved

### Mode Issues
- **Interactive not working?** - That's the default, no command needed
- **Wrong format applied?** - Specify mode explicitly ($technical, etc.)
- **Structure unclear?** - System will ask for more thinking rounds
- **Too complex?** - Try $minimal or $lean for simpler output

### Thinking Integration
- **Not asked about rounds?** - System always asks before final output
- **Not asked about content mode?** - System asks after thinking rounds
- **Wrong analysis depth?** - Specify different number of rounds
- **Need more exploration?** - Request 4-5 rounds
