.

## üí∞ Smart Resource Optimization (Universal)

All Builder prompts include universal resource optimization:

### Phased Implementation
1. **Phase 1 - Core Exploration (Minimal Resources)**: Discover what works through simple prototypes
2. **Phase 2 - Enhancement (Moderate Resources)**: Build on validated patterns
3. **Phase 3 - Premium (High Resources)**: Add complex features only if justified

### Resource-Saving Principles (Universal)
- Use platform free tiers
- Explore concepts before committing
- Let each platform's AI suggest optimal solutions
- Build on successful patterns
- Test before enhancing
- User feedback drives features
- Platform-specific optimizations

### High-Cost Features (Still Flagged)
- Complex animations
- Multiple API integrations
- Real-time features
- Advanced state management
- Large data processing
- Third-party services
- Enterprise features

.

## üé® Creative Direction Matching 

When users provide references, we extract:
- **Mood and feeling** from the design
- **Brand personality** indicators
- **User experience goals**
- **Success patterns** to replicate
- **Emotional targets** to achieve

We DON'T extract:
- Platform-specific code
- Exact pixel measurements
- Rigid component structures
- Fixed implementations
- Prescriptive layouts

.

## üîß Installing MCP Tools (Recommended)

The system intelligently selects between Sequential and Cascade Thinking based on prompt complexity. Choose either Docker (stable) or NPX (quick) installation:

### Option A: AI-Powered Docker Setup (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop installed ([Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Claude Desktop app ([Download Claude](https://claude.ai/download))

**AI-Assisted Installation:**

Copy this prompt to Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant:

```
Help me set up Docker containers for the Prompt Engineering Assistant MCP tools.

I need to:
1. Create a directory at "$HOME/MCP Servers"
2. Clone these repos:
   - https://github.com/sequentialthinking/sequential-thinking-mcp
   - https://github.com/cascadethinking/cascade-thinking-mcp
3. Create a docker-compose.yml file with services for both
4. Configure Claude Desktop's claude_desktop_config.json
5. Start the containers with docker-compose

I'm on [Windows/Mac/Linux]. Please give me the exact commands to run.
```

### Option B: NPX Installation (Quick but Less Stable)

Add to Claude Desktop config file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    },
    "cascade-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "cascade-thinking-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Creative Direction Issues
- **Too prescriptive?** Focus on goals and feelings, not specifications
- **Platform-specific?** Use universal language that works everywhere
- **Not creative enough?** Add mood descriptors and freedom areas
- **Unclear direction?** Use $interactive to clarify goals
- **Resource concerns?** Start with exploration phase only

### MCP Connection Issues
- **Docker not running**: Start Docker Desktop
- **Can't connect**: Restart Claude Desktop
- **Tools not showing**: Restart Claude Desktop after config changes

### Common Setup Problems
- **"Command not found"**: Ensure Node.js is installed for NPX method
- **Containers won't start**: Check Docker Desktop is running
- **Rate limits**: Both tools handle this gracefully with retries
