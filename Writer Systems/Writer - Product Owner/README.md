# Product Owner System - User Guide v5.1.0

The Product Owner system helps teams create professional development tickets, implementation specs, and product documentation through intelligent interactive guidance. By focusing on WHAT needs doing and WHY it matters (not HOW to implement), it bridges the communication gap between product and development teams.

.

## ✨ Key Features

- **4 Intelligent Modes**: Discovery (default), $ticket (auto-scaling), $spec (implementation), $doc (documentation)
- **Native Thinking**: User-controlled thinking rounds for quality output
- **Interactive Everything**: All modes guide users through creation

### Step 5: Start Creating
```
need user authentication         # Discovery flow
$ticket payment integration      # Direct ticket (auto-scales)
$spec modal component           # Direct implementation
$doc analytics dashboard        # Direct documentation
```

After any creation:
```
📦 Add to your workspace?
1. ClickUp - Task management, sprints
2. Skip - Keep as artifact only
```

.

## 🎛️ Operating Modes

| Mode | Command | Purpose | Output | Complexity |
|------|---------|---------|--------|------------|
| **Discovery** | DEFAULT | Figure out what to create | Varies | N/A |
| **Ticket** | `$ticket` | Development tickets | Auto-scales 2-8 sections | Automatic |
| **Spec** | `$spec` | Frontend implementations | Code blocks | N/A |
| **Documentation** | `$doc` | User guides | Feature docs | N/A |

### The New Flow

**No mode specified:**
```
Welcome! Let's figure out what you need. 🤔

What would you like to create?
1. Development ticket
2. Implementation spec
3. Product documentation
```

**With mode specified:**
- `$ticket` → Straight to ticket questions
- `$spec` → Straight to implementation questions
- `$doc` → Straight to documentation questions

**Thinking Rounds (asked after initial input):**
```
How many thinking rounds should I use? (1-10)
- Simple requests: 1-2 rounds
- Standard features: 3-5 rounds  
- Complex initiatives: 6-10 rounds
```

.

## 🎯 Automatic Complexity Detection

### For $ticket Mode

The system intelligently detects complexity based on your responses:

| Indicators | Complexity | Sections | Resolution Items | Suggested Thinking |
|------------|------------|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Bug fix, small change | **Simple** | 2-3 | 4-6 | 1-2 rounds |
| Feature, clear scope | **Standard** | 4-5 | 8-12 | 3-5 rounds |
| Platform, integration | **Complex** | 6-8 | 12-20 | 6-10 rounds |

### Example Flow
```
User: $ticket payment platform

System: Let's create your payment platform ticket! 🎯

How many thinking rounds should I use? (1-10)
Suggested: 6-8 for complex platform work

User: 7

System: Tell me about this payment platform:
- What payment methods?
- New or updating?
- Compliance needs?

[System detects "platform" + multiple requirements = Complex ticket]
[Automatically creates 6-8 section ticket with phases]
```

.

## 💻 Implementation Specs ($spec)

### Interactive & Focused
```
User: $spec data table

System: Let's build your data table! 🔧

How many thinking rounds should I use? (1-10)
Suggested: 2-3 for component implementation

User: 3

System: Quick setup:
1. Framework? (React/Vue/Vanilla)
2. Features? (sorting, filtering, pagination)
3. Data size?

[Generates optimized, working code]
```

.

## 📚 Documentation ($doc)

### User-Focused Guides
```
User: $doc user dashboard

System: Let's document the user dashboard! 📚

How many thinking rounds should I use? (1-10)
Suggested: 2-3 for documentation

User: 2

System: 1. Who will read this? (end users/internal/both)
2. How many features to cover?
3. Documentation depth?

[Creates structured user documentation]
```

.

## 🔗 Platform Integration

### After Every Creation
```markdown
📦 **Add to your workspace?**

1. **ClickUp** - Task management, sprints, time tracking
2. **Skip** - Keep as artifact only

Which option? (1 or 2)
```

### Smart Detection
- **ClickUp** detects: Sprints, bugs, tasks, time tracking, help center

.

## 🔧 Installing MCP Tools

### Docker Setup (AI-Assisted) - For ClickUp Integration Only

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop ([Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Claude Desktop ([Download](https://claude.ai/download))

**Installation:**

Copy this prompt to any AI assistant:
```
Help me set up Docker container for ClickUp MCP tool.

I need to:
1. Create directory at "$HOME/MCP Servers"
2. Clone: https://github.com/taazkareem/clickup-mcp-server
3. Create docker-compose.yml for the service
4. Configure claude_desktop_config.json
5. Set up environment variables for ClickUp API key
6. Start container

I'm on [Windows/Mac/Linux]. Give me exact commands.
```

### Getting API Keys

**ClickUp:**
1. Settings → Apps → API Token
2. Generate Personal Token
3. Add to `.env`

.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Mode Issues
- **Discovery not working?** - That's the default, no command needed
- **Thinking rounds confusing?** - System suggests based on complexity
- **Ticket complexity wrong?** - System auto-detects, provide more context
- **Spec/Doc discovery?** - They skip discovery, go straight to questions

### Platform Integration
- **Not seeing offer?** - Appears after every creation in chat
- **MCP unavailable?** - Check Docker container for ClickUp
- **Wrong workspace?** - MCPs auto-detect patterns

### Common Issues
- **Too many choices?** - v5.1 uses native thinking, simpler setup
- **Missing ⌥ symbol?** - Replaces ≈ for "Reasons why"
- **Want old modes?** - $ticket now handles all complexities

.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Core Changes in v5.1.0

- **User-controlled rounds** - Choose thinking depth (1-10)
- **Unified ticket mode** - One command, intelligent scaling
