The Product Owner system helps teams create professional development tickets, implementation specs, and product documentation through intelligent interactive guidance. By focusing on WHAT needs doing and WHY it matters (not HOW to implement), it bridges the communication gap between product and development teams.

3. Product documentation
```

**With mode specified:**
- `$ticket` → Straight to ticket questions
- `$spec` → Straight to implementation questions

| Indicators | Complexity | Sections | Resolution Items | Suggested Thinking |
|------------|------------|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Bug fix, small change | **Simple** | 2-3 | 4-6 | 1-2 rounds |
| Feature, clear scope | **Standard** | 4-5 | 8-12 | 3-5 rounds |
| Platform, integration | **Complex** | 6-8 | 12-20 | 6-10 rounds |

- **Thinking rounds confusing?** - System suggests based on complexity
=======
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
- **Ticket complexity wrong?** - System auto-detects, provide more context
- **Spec/Doc discovery?** - They skip discovery, go straight to questions

### Platform Integration
- **Not seeing offer?** - Appears after every creation in chat
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- **MCP unavailable?** - Check Docker container for ClickUp
- **Wrong workspace?** - MCPs auto-detect patterns

### Common Issues
- **Too many choices?** - v5.1 uses native thinking, simpler setup
=======
- **MCP unavailable?** - Check Docker containers
- **Wrong workspace?** - MCPs auto-detect patterns

### Common Issues
- **Too many choices?** - v5.0 reduced choices, trust the system
