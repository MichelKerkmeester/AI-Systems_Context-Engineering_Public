---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Choose Your Mode

```bash
$prototype ($lp)  # Visual mockups, animations, no backend (CIS: 1-3)
$website ($lw)    # Landing pages, SEO, conversions (CIS: 2-6)
$app ($la)        # Full-stack apps with Supabase (CIS: 3-10)
```

### Credit-Conscious Usage

**Prototype (Low Credit):**
```
$lp Create static dashboard design
```
→ Static mockup, no animations (Saves 70% credits)

**Website (Medium Credit):**
```
$lw Build landing page, defer integrations
```
→ Core pages only, static forms (Saves 60% credits)

**App (Optimized):**
```
$la Create todo app with mock data first
```
→ Functional UI, no backend initially (Saves 80% credits)

---

## 💰 Credit Impact Scores (CIS)

| Score | Category | Action | Examples |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| **1-3** | Low | Auto-implement | Static layouts, Tailwind utilities, mock data |
| **4-6** | Medium | Ask first | Forms, basic animations, simple auth |
| **7-10** | High | Require approval | Real-time, file uploads, complex state |

---

## 🎯 Mode Comparison v1.1.0

| Mode | Framework | Credit Budget | Phases | Best For |
|------|-----------|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Prototype** | VISION | 20-40% | Static → Interactive → Animated | Mockups, demos |
| **Website** | CONVERT | 30-60% | Core → Trust → Advanced | Landing pages |
| **App** | SCALE | 30-100% | MVP → Enhanced → Production | SaaS, dashboards |

---

## 🏗️ Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core (Auto-Build)
- **Budget:** 20-30% credits
- **Focus:** Essential functionality only
- **Strategy:** Static first, mock data, reuse everything

### Phase 2: Enhanced (Ask First)
- **Budget:** 30-40% credits
- **Focus:** Proven features only
- **Strategy:** Add after validation, simple implementations

### Phase 3: Advanced (Explicit Approval)
- **Budget:** 30-40% credits
- **Focus:** Complex features if justified
- **Strategy:** Require metrics, provide alternatives

---

## 📊 New Metrics & Tracking

### Credit Dashboard (All Modes)
```tsx
// Real-time credit tracking
Phase 1: 18% / 30% ✅
Phase 2: 0% / 35% ⏸️
Phase 3: 0% / 35% 🔒
Total Savings: 72%
```

### Conversion-Credit Ratio (Website Mode)
```
Feature: Contact Form
Impact: 8/10 | Cost: 3/10
CCR: 2.67 ✅ (Above 2.0 threshold)
```

### Architecture Decision Records (App Mode)
```
Decision: Local state vs Redux
Choice: Local state
Savings: 40% credits
Migration: Add Redux if needed later
```

## 🎨 Visual Reference Matching

### When Providing Screenshots/Mockups:

1. **Automatic Extraction**
   - Colors, typography, spacing
   - Layout structure
   - Component inventory

2. **Exact Replication**
   - Pixel-perfect matching
   - Preserve all visual details
   - Match before optimizing

3. **Credit Optimization**
   - Reuse identified patterns
   - Static first approach
   - Defer animations

---

## 💡 Credit-Saving Patterns

### Universal Strategies
```bash
# Pattern 1: Mock First
Mock data → Local storage → Database
Saves: 60-80% initial credits

# Pattern 2: Static First  
Static → CSS animations → JS animations
Saves: 50-70% animation credits

# Pattern 3: Reuse Everything
ShadCN → Tailwind utilities → Custom only if needed
Saves: 40-60% component credits
```

### Mode-Specific Savings

**Prototype:**
- 70% static, 20% basic interactions, 10% advanced
- Use CSS transitions over JS animations
- Limit to 3-5 screens initially

**Website:**
- Homepage gets 40% budget, other pages 10% each
- Static forms before integrations
- One conversion goal at a time

**App:**
- MVP at 30% budget maximum
- Mock all data initially
- Add backend only after validation

## 🚨 STOP Checkpoints

### Mandatory Approval Points:

```
🛑 CIS 7+ Feature Detected
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Feature: Real-time updates
Credit Impact: HIGH (50% budget)
Alternative: Polling (10% budget)

Proceed? [Use Alternative] [Approve] [Defer]
```

## 📋 Quick Reference v1.1.0

```bash
# Prototype - Visual mockups (Low Credit)
$lp [element] static first, animate if needed

# Website - Marketing sites (Medium Credit)
$lw [site type] core pages only, enhance later

# App - Full applications (Phased Credit)
$la [app type] MVP first, validate, then enhance
```

### Credit Commands
```bash
# Check credit usage
Show credit dashboard

# Evaluate feature
Calculate CIS for [feature]

# Find alternatives
Suggest low-credit alternative for [feature]
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes v1.1.0

- **Always extract visual references first** - Match exactly before optimizing
- **Credit awareness is mandatory** - Track and report usage
- **Phase implementation required** - Never build everything at once
- **Reuse before creating** - Check library first
- **Mock before real** - Always start with mock data
- **Ask before CIS 7+** - High-credit features need approval
